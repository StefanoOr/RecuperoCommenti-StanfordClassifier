DESIGN	Agency manages Critics Since classes are not really first class objects in java a singleton instance of Agency is made and passed around as needed The Agency keeps a registry of all Critics that should be applied to each type of design material When a design material instance is critiqued it asks Agency to apply all registered Critics In the current scheme there is a thread that proactively continuously critiques the Design at hand even if the user is idle!

DESIGN	Delete a model element Implements cascading delete to make sure model is still valid after element has been deleted<p> The actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the factories For example a method deleteClass exists on CoreHelper Delete methods as deleteClass should only do those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself Ie deleteClass should only take care of things specific to UmlClass<p> The delete methods in the UML Factories should not be called directly throughout the code! Calls should always refer to this method and never call the deleteXXX method on XXXFactory directly The reason that it is possible to call the deleteXXX methods directly is a pure implementation detail<p> The implementation of this method uses a quite complicated ifthenelse tree This is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the UML 14 metamodel The last remark refers to the fact that the UML 14 model uses multiple inheritance in several places This has to be taken into account<p> TODO The requirements of the metamodel could probably be better determined by reflection on the metamodel Then each association that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure that it meets the requirements and if not be deleted tfm<p> Extensions and its children are not taken into account here They do not require extra cleanup actions Not in the form of a call to the remove method as is normal for all children of MBase and not in the form of other behaviour we want to implement via this operation param elem The element to be deleted see orgargoumlmodelUmlFactorydeletejavalangObject

DESIGN	Dont use tinyint for now even though Mckoi supports it Its notion of tinyint is 7bit not 8bit so it is not compatible with other DBs and leads to overflow resulting in negative values which are a corruption of the actual value insertedupdated This is not a great workaround I filed a bug report on the mailing list hopefully it will get fixed soon

DESIGN	For some reason when the Oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the tabPnls first tab ends up being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab This causes the tabs length to be 1 tab greater than the tabs that are actually in the tabPnl This throws off the selection such that the tab selected in the tab panel doesnt get rendered until the tab to the right of the selected tab is selected This is a workaround for this problem until I can determine why the DatabaseObjectInfoTab never makes it into the tabPnl in the first place

DESIGN	KLUDGE We want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations Ideally we would get that info inside the ResultSetDataSet class during the creation of the columnDefinition objects by using various functions in ResultSetMetaData such as isNullableidx Unfortunately in at least some DBMSs eg Postgres HSDB the results of those calls are not the same and are less accurate than the SQLMetaDatagetColumns call used in ColumnsTab to get the column info Even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same with the ResultSetMetadata listing things not provided by getColumns Most of the data provided by the ResultSetMetaData calls is correct However the nullablenotnullable property is not set correctly in at least two DBMSs while it is correct for those DBMSs in the getColumns info Therefore we collect the collumn nullability information from getColumns and pass that info to the ResultSet to override what it got from the ResultSetMetaData

DESIGN	Need to somehow call SQLResultExecuterPanelreRunSelectedResultTabtrue Something like SQLResultExecuterPanel panel = getPanel panelreRunSelectedResultTabtrue However that doesnt apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table There needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders For now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually rerun the query reload the table data and reexport

DESIGN	Note incorrect here we are using the hack in bsh class manager that allows lookup by base name We need to eliminate this limitation by working through imports See notes in class manager
DESIGN	Note is using SignatureKey in this way dangerous? In the pathological case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of argument types to an untyped method Maybe we could be smarter about it by ignoring the types of untyped parameter positions? The method resolver could return a set of hints for the signature key caching? There is also the overhead of creating one of these for every method dispatched What is the alternative?

DESIGN	note that i parameter is now unused delete it?
DESIGN	Note that the way they are sorted the values of indexi++ always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list EATM TODO We could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result 
DESIGN	note that this method could easily be moved up to BasicEntityPersister if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
DESIGN	Note the bsh command code should probably not be here we need to scope it by the namespace that imported the command so it probably needs to be integrated into NameSpace 
DESIGN	NOTE the handling of simple vs doublequotes could be formally more accurate but I cant imagine a session id containing either so we should be OK The whole set of expressions is a quick hack anyway so who cares
DESIGN	note there is a wierd implementation in the client side
DESIGN	NOTE this assumes something about how propertySelectFragment is implemented by the subclass! was toUnqotedAliasStrings getdiscriminatorColumnName before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases
DESIGN	NOTE this assumes something about how propertySelectFragment is implemented by the subclass! was toUnqotedAliasStrings getIdentiferColumnNames before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases
DESIGN	Note This class essentially just delegates most of its methods to its parent The setVariable indirection is very small We could probably fold this functionality back into the base NameSpace as a special case But this has changed a few times so Id like to leave this abstraction for now 
DESIGN	Note This class is messy The method and field resolution need to be rewritten Various methods in here catch NoSuchMethod or NoSuchField exceptions during their searches These should be rewritten to avoid having to catch the exceptions Method lookups are now cached at a high level so they are less important however the logic is messy 
DESIGN	Note this could be made clearer by adding an inner class for the cases and an object context for the child traversal 
DESIGN	Note this implementation is temporary We currently keep a flat namespace of the base name of classes ie BeanShell cannot be in the process of defining two classes in different packages with the same base name To remove this limitation requires that we work through namespace imports in an analogous or using the same path as regular class import resolution This workaround should handle most cases so well try it for now 
DESIGN	Note this impor pattern is becoming common could factor it out into an importedObject Vector class 
DESIGN	Note this method and resolveExpectedJavaField should be rewritten to invert this logic so that no exceptions need to be caught unecessarily This is just a temporary impl return the field or null if not found 
DESIGN	Note this should really just throw NoSuchFieldException need to change related signatures and code 
DESIGN	NOTE VERY HACKISH WORKAROUND!! TODO Fix this so it will work for nonPOJO entity mode
DESIGN	Note We intentionally dont remember internal plugins because we dont want them to appear in the plugin manager currently TODO improve plugin manager dialog to support internal plugins which cant be removed etc
DESIGN	Note we need a form of eval that passes the callstack through 
DESIGN	Note we need a singleton here so that things like this == this work and probably a good idea for speed Caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the declaringInterpreter could be different under some circumstances Case a child interpreter running a source eval command However the effect is just that the main interpreter that executes your script should be the one involved in callbacks from Java I do not know if there are corner cases where a child interpreter would be the first to use a This reference in a namespace or if that would even cause any problems if it did We could do some experiments to find out and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter basis if we had weak references We might also look at skipping over child interpreters and going to the parent for the declaring interpreter so wed be sure to get the top interpreter 
DESIGN	Note We will ll move this behavior out to a subclass of NameSpace but well start here 
DESIGN	Note which of these things should be checked at parse time vs run time? 
DESIGN	Notes It would not be hard to eliminate the use of orgobjectwebasmType from this class making the distribution a tiny bit smaller

DESIGN	Objecttoa is obsolete We match Rubys hack until toa goes away Then we can remove this hack too
DESIGN	OK this is a hack Currently when precision == scale I have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data The problem comes when the source dbs precisionscale are greater or reported to be greater than the precisionscale of the destination db In this case it maximimizes both for the destination causing a definition that allows 0 digits to the left of the decimal Trouble is without looking at the actual data there is no way to tell if this is valid in some cases it will be ok 00000000789 in others it will not be ok 100123 So for now make the scale be approx onehalf of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases

DESIGN	Silently ignore what could we do anyway?
DESIGN	Silly bug workaround 8694 If you look at the above code note that we restore the saved caret position first then scroll to the saved location However the caret changing can itself result in scrolling to a different location than what was saved and since moveCaretPosition calls updateBracketHighlight the bracket highlights out of bounds calculation will rely on a different set of physical firstlast lines than what we will end up with eventually Instead of confusing the user with status messages that appear at random when switching buffers we simply hide the message altogether

DESIGN	Some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others do not JDBC on some DBMSs does not handle pseudo columns correctly Also getTables returns views as well as tables so the thing we are looking at might not be a table JDBC does not give a simple way to determine what we are looking at since the type of object is described in a DBMSspecific encoding For these reasons rather than testing for all these conditions we just try using the pseudo column info to get the table data and if that fails we try to get the table data without using the pseudo column TODO Should we change the mode from editable to noneditable?

DESIGN	Sometimes the value can be retrieved at compile time If we succeed nothing like it! We might not for the following reasons 1 The constant is missing 2 The reference is a forwardreference 3 The constants value is only known at runtime on firstaccess but this is runtime isnt it?? 4 Our compiler isnt able to right away infer that this is a constant SSS FIXME 1 The operand can be a literal array range or hash hence Operand because Array Range and Hash derive from Operand and not Constant Is there a way to fix this impedance mismatch? 2 It should be possible to handle the forwardreference case by creating a new ForwardReference operand and then inform the scope of the forward reference which the scope can fix up when the reference gets defined At codegen time if the reference is unresolved when a value is retrieved for the forwardref and we get a null we can throw a ConstMissing exception! Not sure!

DESIGN	this covers the rare case of lowercase class names and thus will fail 99999 of the time fortunately well only do this once per package name and seriously folks look into best practices
DESIGN	This does a calculation of where our ext directory is TODO We should eventually make sure that this calculation is only present in one place in the code and not several 
DESIGN	This doesnt look pretty and mode line should probably be split up into seperate componentsstrings 
DESIGN	This doesnt seem very correct but it fixes a problem when setting the initial caret position for a buffer eg from the recent file list
DESIGN	This feels sloppy especially for nonUS locales
DESIGN	This Fig is never placed on a diagram It is only used by the call renderer so that pick list items look like diagram Figs TODO This Fig does not represent a model element and so it should not extend FigNodeModelElement We should split FigNodeModelElement in two one for base functionality for all nodes and one that is truly for model elements

DESIGN	this function has a template > restore output apply the template and write the result out TODO Downcast to avoid using an interface? Yuck
DESIGN	This functionality should eventually go away as it is replaced by model exporters Well just delegate to the deprecated GenPackage method The monitor isnt used so we wont pass it 
DESIGN	This info is merely a placeholder in the tree that we can use to get index name and parent name more easily We probably should create a IndexColumnInfo that has this extra info in it

DESIGN	This is a logically not sufficent try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the JDBC API Doc StatementgetResultSet This method should be called only once per result StatementgetUpdateCount This method should be called only once per result StatementgetMoreResults There are no more results when the following is true !getMoreResults getUpdateCount == 1 If getMoreResults returns false we dont know if we have more results we only know that it isnt a result set Since we called getUpdateCount before getMoreResults because we would like to know the update count of the first result we might not be allowed to call getUpdateCount again The Intersystems Cache Driver for example always returns the same updateCount on simple INSERT UPDATE DELETE statements not matter if getMoreResults was called So updateCount never gets 1 and this will loop forever When I discussed the issue with the Intersystems people they just told me not to call getUpdateCount twice That simple My hope is that this will cure problems with DBs that just dont care for multiple result sets
DESIGN	This is a particularly nasty bit of code that checks for a parameter entity reference but peeks ahead to catch the in parameter entity declarations
DESIGN	This is a rather hairy case One of our subclasses knows that we need to update the archive but at the same time there are no resources known to us that would need to be added Only the subclass seems to know whats going on This happens if <jar> detects that the manifest has changed for example The manifest is not part of any resources because of our support for inline <manifest>s If we invoke createEmptyZip like Ant 152 did well loose all stuff that has been in the original archive bugzilla report 17780 
DESIGN	this is a rather ugly hack but similar to MRI See hashcrubysetenv and similar in MRI we search all keys for a caseinsensitive match and use that
DESIGN	this is a sloppy hack to fix bug 677902 hitting return after collapsed fold the idea is that if we extend the range then the problem described in the bug happends so if the insert is at the very end of the range we dont extend it instead we push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly we also have to mess with screen line counts 
DESIGN	This is a template method called by the ArgoUML framework as the result of a change to a model element Do not call this method directly yourself <p>Override this in any subclasses in order to change what model elements the FigNode is listening to as a result of change to the model <p> <p>This method is guaranteed by the framework to be running on the same thread as the model subsystem<p> TODO Lets refactor this at some time to take UmlChangeEvent argument param event the UmlChangeEvent that caused the change

DESIGN	This is deprecated use classespath in the future
DESIGN	this is done here cos we might only know the type here ugly! TODO improve this a lot
DESIGN	This is effectively the same as savertoXMLObject Writer except we get to provide the DataHolder Dont know why there is no method for this in the XStream class
DESIGN	This is faintly ridiculous
DESIGN	This is for JRUBY2988 since after a suspend the terminal seems to need to be reinitialized Since we cant easily detect suspension initialize after every readline Probably not fast but this is for interactive terminals anywayso who cares?

DESIGN	This is the interface for registering interest in events sent from the model component<p> Neither the registration or unregistration nor the events themselves contain any reference to the model implementation Instead they use the link javabeansPropertyChangeListener link javabeansPropertyChangeEvent to deliver events<p> The reference to the listener is a WeakReference so you dont need to call removeWHATEVERListener you can just forget about your listener and it is eventually finalized and removed This also means that you will have to keep a reference to your listener while it is active Since the garbage collecting mechanism is not really deterministic a forgotten about listener might still receive events Unless it can handle them in a harmless way this approach should not be used TODO Is this still true or does it refer to the NSUML implementation? tfm 20051109 This is part of the contract that is established between the Model subsystem and its users If that is not fulfilled by the current implementation then the current implementation is incorrect Linus 20060411<p> TODO What event names? The event names generated are link Strings and their values and meanings are not really well documented In general they are the name of an an association end or attribute in the UML metamodel<p> Here are some highlights<ul> <li>remove event sent when the element is removed <ul> author Linus Tolke 
DESIGN	This is the main class for the GUI subsystem<p> Users of the GUI subsystem ie components that are to place themselves in any of the GUI components register themselves in this class<p> TODO Add the rest of the registers to this author Linus Tolke since 0213 
DESIGN	This is the namespace in which the method is set It is a backreference for the node which needs to execute under this namespace It is not necessary to declare this transient because we can only be saved as part of our namespace anyway currently 
DESIGN	This is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath The code is currently the same you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files
DESIGN	This is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	this is the temporary solution for issue 1011

DESIGN	This is ugly
DESIGN	this is ugly here but needed because its a subquery
DESIGN	This is used by SessionFactoryImpl to hand to the generated SessionImpl was the only reason I could see that we cannot just use null as SettingscacheProvider
DESIGN	This is weird if I dont set this the column header doesnt line up with the column contents
DESIGN	this is where checked exceptions piss me off this method only uses a StringReader which can never throw an exception
DESIGN	this is wrongly called with a null handle as a workaround we return an empty collection
DESIGN	This keeps track of the editing domain that is used to track all changes to the model <p> TODO This probably needs to be a set of EditingDomain so that we can manage an EditingDomain per project 
DESIGN	this listener priority thing is a bad hack
DESIGN	this may be negative
DESIGN	this may be obsolete not used anywhere
DESIGN	This may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities
DESIGN	This method has insufficient information to call buildExtensionPoint Thus well need to create one and pray that whomever called us knows what kind of mess they got
DESIGN	this method is a nightmare
DESIGN	This method should be rewritten to use getFields and avoid catching exceptions during the search 
DESIGN	this needs to be split since conditional calling inherited doesnt fit standard ruby semantics
DESIGN	This next bit is to allow for both unsavedvalue=negative and for older behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object TODO shift it into unsavedvalue strategy
DESIGN	This node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other FigNodes in ArgoUML It is actually an optional child fig or more precisely a path item of a FigEdgeModelElement This allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a comment to some other edge type GEF can only attach edges to nodes by making this fig both a node and containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge connections TODO We are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we dont really require We should attempt to make FigEdgePort extend FigNode author Bob Tarling 
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set TODO calling entrySet on an IdentityMap is SLOW!!

DESIGN	This sets up the editing domain for the model editor TODO We probably need an EditingDomain per Argo project so that we can keep the ResourceSets separate 
DESIGN	this should be before dockables are initialized 
DESIGN	this should be moved to a ui action
DESIGN	This should be per instance
DESIGN	this should just bring back one table i hope 
DESIGN	This should NOT be looking for a NamedElement since this is not always about the name of this modelelement alone
DESIGN	This should probably be in Reflectjava
DESIGN	This should probably be inside xmiReaderparse but there is another place in this source where XMIReader is used but it appears to be the NSUML XMIReader When Argo XMIReader is used consistently it can be responsible for loading the listener Until then do it here
DESIGN	This tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when importing If it is set then the critics could ignore those objects if they want TODO This is really belongs in a higher level utility class that uses the Facades tagged value methods Also it needs to be updated to use a UML 14 TagDefinition instead of a simple String 
DESIGN	this will probably not get used Object type
DESIGN	throws SAXException when things go wrong with SAX throws IOException when theres an IO error throws ParserConfigurationException when the parser finds wrong syntax TODO Unused? 
DESIGN	TO DO these annotations only work with XYPlot see if it is possible to make ContourPlot a subclass of XYPlot DG
DESIGN	To resize only when a new concurrent region is added changing the height TODO Probably shouldnt exist as this class should be listening for added concurrent regions and call this internally itself param h the new height 
DESIGN	To simplify implementation we list all associations found with any of the Classifiers represented by the linked Instances <p> TODO Make a foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations that create a correct model Also take into account nary associations and associationclasses This algo best goes in the model subsystem eg in a method getAllPossibleAssociationsForALink see orgargoumlumluiUMLComboBoxModelbuildModelList

DESIGN	TODO Because we get called on each and every change event when the model is in a state of flux well often get an InvalidElementException before we finish this collection The only saving grace is that were called SO many times that on the last time things should be stable again and well get a good set of elements for the final update We need a better mechanism

DESIGN	TODO Bob says the reflective code following should be replaced with something more specific like this commented out code This would mean we need sType changed to a meta type Object rather than a String
DESIGN	TODO Bob says This is a really nasty horrible hack ShadowFig should not extend FigNodeModelElement Instead we require a base class FigNode with common behaviour of ALL nodes in ArgoUML ShadowFig should extend that and FigNodeModelElement should extend that same base class adding common functionality for FigNode that represent model element see orgargoumlumldiagramuiFigNodeModelElementsetShadowSizeint 
DESIGN	TODO Bob says we should not be listening here for addition and removal of attributes This should be done in FigAttributesCompartment

DESIGN	TODO calcBounds is called by SelectionManager when the Fig is dragged This code is needed to reposition any self message as they are become detached from their classifier role see issue 5562 The cause of the detachment is not yet understood Unfortunately calcBounds is called from several other places so the code here is not optimal but is the best workaround until ArgoUML can provide its own replacement SelectionManager for sequence diagram requirements See httpgeftigrisorgissuesshowbugcgi?id=344

Trivial to fix then Just store and expose the node name on the entity persister which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means

DESIGN	TODO should the engine be static?
DESIGN	TODO Should the method signature of this method be changed to match the superimplementation using a TestElement parameter instead of AbstractListenerElement? This would require an instanceof check before adding the listener below but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for subclasses the Java rules dealing with this situation arent always intuitive and a subclass may think it is calling this version of the method when it is really calling the superclass version instead
DESIGN	TODO should these fields be public? They dont appear to be used externally Also are they any different from HTTPConstantsGET etc ?

DESIGN	TODO Somehow add the newly created foreign keys to the internal collection
DESIGN	TODO something much better look at the type of the other expression! TODO Have comparisonExpression andor arithmeticExpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes
DESIGN	TODO SPATIAL and FULLTEXT indexes require a MyISAM engine for the table Is there a way to tell what engine is being used for a table? It may not be necessary since the following doenst hurt if already a MyISAM engine ALTER TABLE mytable ENGINE = MYISAM Still this is not the kind of thing we would want to do automatically since MyISAM engine is nontransactional We will probably need to tell the user somehow that they need this otherwise the create index statement will fail Maybe a comment in the script and if they happen to read it they could uncomment the conversion of the engine? Maybe a custom dialog?

DESIGN	TODO The above populate works but seems rather heavy here I can see something like this is needed though as events wont manage this quick enough Could we make FigEditableCompartmentcreateModelElement create the new child Fig instance? It may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return Bob
DESIGN	TODO the above works in the current situation but its just a hack How to get each editor to report whether it wants to grow bigger? Whether the property label should be at the left or at the top of the editor? ?

DESIGN	TODO the subplot areas needs to be moved out of the plot into the plot state

DESIGN	TODO This functionality is in the worn place We should be able to call setVisible on the compartment itself and then this class should react to that event Improvements will follow in later releases Hence this method should not be considered stable for module developers param compartment the compartment to be changed param isVisible true if the attribute compartment is visible

DESIGN	TODO This is actually a hack! Some diagram types like the statechart diagrams access the current diagram to get some info This might cause problems if theres another statechart diagram active so I remove the current project before loading the new one
DESIGN	TODO This is actually now returning the scope of whoever called Methodtoproc which is obviously wrong but theres no scope to provide for many methods It fixes JRUBY2237 but needs a better solution

DESIGN	TODO this is kinda gross

DESIGN	TODO this is one of the ugliest and most fragile pieces of code in Hibernate

DESIGN	TODO This is probably not the right location for switching off the filterNewlines The setting gets lost after selecting a different ModelElement in the diagram BTW see how it is used in javaxswingtextPlainDocument See issue 1812 
DESIGN	TODO This is probably related to the SendEvent that is sending the Signal but the association is not navigable in that direction
DESIGN	TODO this is really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone requires something we should try to make LoadPath a special array object

DESIGN	TODO This version is better than the hackish previous one Windows behavior needs to be defined though I suppose this version could be improved more too TODO etcpasswd is also inadequate for MacOSX since it does not use etcpasswd for regular user accounts 
DESIGN	todo this was added to support initializing an entitys EntityEntry snapshot during reattach
DESIGN	TODO This whole class needs to be updated to remove use of deprecated methods and hopefully test multiroot and multiproject methods since Nov 17 2002 author jaapbranderhorstxs4allnl 
DESIGN	TODO This will need to be adapted to send undoredo commands back to our consumer eg ArgoUML if a new undo mechanism is implemented for the Model subsystem tfm
DESIGN	TODO This will vary based on the type of the TagDefinition
DESIGN	TODO This wont work when the column has values with quotes in them Use PreparedStatements instead Hmmm instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a uses the sequence for the pkid b selects distinct values That would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem

DESIGN	TODO We could generalize this to initialize more stuff if needed
DESIGN	TODO We currently delete the old values before setting to something new This is a workaround to issue 6056 We should consider giving an API to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values
DESIGN	TODO We definitely dont want to react to addition and removal of transitions Cant we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener
DESIGN	TODO we didnt check the width yet
DESIGN	TODO We dont want to do this once we have dropped UML13 Map UML 14 names to UML 13 equivalents
DESIGN	TODO We have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should be consolidated This form is used by orgargoumlumlreveng
DESIGN	TODO We have some quirk that the a baseClass addition or removal from a steroetype comes back as an AttributeChangeEvent rather than an AssociationChangeEvent This needs further investigation to see if this can be made consistent
DESIGN	TODO we may also want to check that the types here map to exactly one columnJDBCtype cant think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multicolumn mappings makes any sense
DESIGN	TODO We may want to restrict the list to parameters which conform to the following WFR parametertype = ofstype or parameterkind = in and ofstypeallSupertypes>includestype or parameterkind = out or parameterkind = return and typeallSupertypes>includesofstype or parameterkind = inout and ofstypeallSupertypes>includestype or typeallSupertypes>includesofstype

DESIGN	TODO We need to rethrow this as some other exception type but that is too much change for the moment
DESIGN	TODO We probably should have a StatisticsNotPublishedException to make it clean
DESIGN	TODO we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hqlsql grammar expects all those node types to be FromReferenceNodes One potential fix here would be to convert the IntoClause to just use a FromClauseFromElement combo as a child of the InsertStatement and move all this logic into the InsertStatement Thats probably the easiest approach read least amount of changes to the grammar and code but just doesnt feel right as then an insert would contain 2 fromclauses
DESIGN	TODO We really only care about events which affect things that are visible in the current perspective view This could be tailored to cut down on event traffic tfm 20060410
DESIGN	TODO We really want this class to have package scope however the reflection
DESIGN	TODO we really want to be able replace the initial content handler which is passed to SAX but we cant do this without cloning a whole bunch of code because its private in the super class
DESIGN	TODO we should be able to optimize this quite a bit post10 JavaClass already has all the methods organized by method name the next version supporting protected methodsfields will have them organized even further So collectMethods here can just lookup the overridden methods in the JavaClass map should be much faster
DESIGN	TODO we should be given an Undo manager to use rather than looking for a global one
DESIGN	TODO we should check if we need an vector or better another list implementation checking also if the list must be syncronized or not performance
DESIGN	TODO we should provide some way to get keys of collection of statistics to make it easier to retrieve from a GUI perspective
DESIGN	TODO We should really be passing the default settings to the diagram factory so they get set at creation time
DESIGN	todo we should really just collect these from the various SelectExpressions rather than regenerating here
DESIGN	TODO We should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default This depends on the default profile configuration containing the type Integer to test properly Otherwise it will get created in the main project defeating the purpose
DESIGN	TODO We should really test the model instead for this but we have no API yet Can we just check if the collection to build the JList control implements the List interface?
DESIGN	TODO we should throw an exception if we really know for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new StaleObjectStateExceptionentityName id
DESIGN	TODO We shouldnt actually have to do all this work

DESIGN	TODO Workaround for GEF redraw problem Force all child figs into the same layer
DESIGN	TODO would be great to have a MappinghasNonIdentifierPropertyNamedId method I dont believe that MappinggetReferencedPropertyType accounts for the identifier property so if it returns for a property named id then we should have a nonid field named id

DESIGN	Updates a compartment box Called from updateLayout if there is a model event effecting the attributesoperations and from renderingChanged in all cases TODO The above statement means that the entire contents of the compartments are being rebuilt whenever an addremove of an attribute operation or a reception is detected It would be better to have compartments listen for add and remove events and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild Remark MVW This is a bit exaggerated since the populate method is already heavily optimized 
DESIGN	Updates the top level ModelElements for all projects In UML2 each model knows its root elements so this could make setRoots obsolete Eg applying a stereotype in UML2 adds a new root TODO This is redundant with setRootsgetRoots There are already too many ways this stuff is managed without adding an additional one All current model subsystem implementations know their top level elements Responsibility can be moved to the model subsystem but lets choose one way of managing this

Surely encoding information for XML serialization is a well known task tfm I have never understood why this is being done I think we should remove any usage bob param	str	The String to encode return	The encoded String 
DESIGN	VERY IMPORTANT!!!! This class needs to be free of any static references to any CGLIB or Javassist classes Otherwise users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which if either they use Another option here would be to remove the HibernateisPropertyInitialized method and have the users go through the SessionFactory to get this information
DESIGN	very wrong

DESIGN	We set expected and checksum to 1 here since we dont have that information for releasexml file TODO Can HttpClient be used to get the bytesize of releasexml so we can perform this check?
DESIGN	We should actually rework this class to not implement Parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way
DESIGN	We should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to processing a stream of tokens we instead build up a tree of expressions
DESIGN	We use a highly uncommon string to represent the paragraph delimiter 100 soln not worth it 
DESIGN	We would probably refactor to have LogicParser builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not ExpressionParser translates from OO terms like foo fooBar fooBarBaz to SQL terms like FOOSID FOOSBARID etc and PathExpressionParser which does much the same thing it does now

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	1st step As explained above resizing an instruction may require to resize another one which may require to resize yet another one and so on The first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instructions that need to be resized without modifying the code This is done by the following fix point algorithm parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than 2 bytes to be stored the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instructions For each such instruction adds an entry in a copy of the indexes and sizes arrays if this has not already been done in a previous iteration! if at least one entry has been added during the previous step go back to the beginning otherwise stop In fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of TABLESWITCH and LOOKUPSWITCH instructions depends on their position in the bytecode because of padding In order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the number of bytes to be added or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop is finished this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of the method

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	An additional note on using HashSets to store URLs I just discovered that obtaining the hashCode of a javanetURL implies a domainname resolution process This means significant delays can occur even more so if the domain name is not resolvable Whether this can be a problem in practical situations I cant tell but thought Id keep a note just in case BTW note that using a List and removing duplicates via scan would not help since URLequals requires name resolution too The above problem has now been addressed with the URLString and URLCollection classes

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	beautiful output 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because CollectionPropertymergeIn will not prevent adding two properties of the same name we need to select the first value so that this elements values prevail over defaults provided by configuration elements
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	because its preferred size can be quite wide we dont want it to make the browser way too big so set the preferred width to 0
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	because numeric can be anything
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	because of the crosscatalog problem lets not invoke this if the current catalog isnt equal to the catalog specified in the URL 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because of the way I create the full target path there must be NO slash at the end of targetFolder and folderName However if the slash or backslash is the only character leave it alone
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because Regexp=== sets backref we have to make this backrefaware
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because the clipRects height is usually an even multiple of the font height we subtract 1 from it otherwise one too many lines will always be painted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because the content is only read the file will not be damaged I tested with JPG ZIP and PDF as binary files
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because the notation events get dispatched on the Swing event thread we need to use invokeAndWait to make sure that we dont return until theyve been delivered
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	because this method is called for every VFS update we dont want to scan the tree all the time So we use the following algorithm to determine if the path might be part of the tree if the path starts with the browsers current directory we do the tree scan if the browsers directory is favorites we have to do the tree scan as every path can appear under the favorites list if the browsers directory is roots and path is on the local filesystem do a tree scan
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because UML 14 21 metamodels are organized differently we need to traverse the hierarchy looking for our owning Package
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because we get the metatype class stripped of its reflective proxies we need to jump through a hoop or two to find it in the metamodel then work from there to get its proxy 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because we implement Java interfaces now we need a new === thats aware of those additional virtual supertypes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Because we map both ends of an association well see many names twice LOGlogLevelFINE Duplicate property name found 01 new ObjecttypeName propertyName
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	because were listening for stereotypes being added and removed but were really interested in their owned tag definitions the default implementation wont work for us

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	BLOB exists so try to read the data from it based on the users directions
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	BLOBs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the DB is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself During the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read Therefore we do not need to reread the datum from the Database because we know that we have the entire descriptor If the contents of the BLOB have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	DataTypes may limit the initial data read from the DB eg to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table To edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing Therefore we ask the DataType if we need to reread the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed If there is a problem during the read eg we cannot identify exactly one row in the DB matching the current row in the table then the cell is not editable The reverse is not true if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	DB2 cannot alter a columns null attribute directly only through constraints Not only that but its apparently not a valid thing to do to create a primary key using a column that has been made not null via a check constraint Therefore the only columns that qualify to be made PKs are those that were declared not null at the time of table creation
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	DB2 doesnt support adding an autoincrement column once the table has already been created So this can simulate one using trigger on the table to access a sequence Found this idea at wikibooks httpenwikibooksorgwikiSQLdialectsreferenceDatastructuredefinitionAutoincrementcolumn CREATE SEQUENCE sequencename CREATE TABLE tablename columnname INT CREATE TRIGGER inserttrigger NO CASCADE BEFORE INSERT ON tablename REFERENCING NEW AS n FOR EACH ROW SET ncolumnname = NEXTVAL FOR sequencename

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a 1to1 we can directly create a SetCommand 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a 1tomany association doing the set as a remove and add from the other end will make it undoable In particular if there is an existing nonnull value we first need to remove it from the other end so that it will be reinserted at the correct index on undo 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a Classifier <pre> 10 The operation allContents returns a Set containing all ModelElements contained in the Classifier together with the contents inherited from its parents allContents SetModelElement allContents = selfcontents>union selfparentallContents>selecte | eelementOwnershipvisibility = public or eelementOwnershipvisibility = protected where parent is defined for GeneralizableElement as 1 The operation parent returns a Set containing all direct parents parent SetGeneralizableElement parent = selfgeneralizationparent <pre><p>

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a manyto1 or 1to1 association if the opposite reference on the new value is already set to something we need a compound command that first explicitly removes that reference so that it will be restored in the undo 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a manyto1 we use SetCommandcreate to create the command to remove the opposite reference a RemoveCommand on its opposite will actually result 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a manytomany association the command can only be undoable if the value or owner is last in its respective list since the undo will include an inverse add So if the value is last but the owner is not we create an undoable compound command that removes from the opposite end and then inserts the new value 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	For a match to be found it has to have the same owner and the same long class name

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	get WHERE clause The 1 says to ignore the last arg and use the contents of the values array for the column that we care about However since the data in that column has been limited when getWhereClause calls that DataType with that value the DataType will see that the data has been limited and therefore cannnot be used in the WHERE clause In some cases it may be possible for the DataType to use the partial data such as matches <data> but that may not be standard accross all Databases and thus may be risky

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	getSimplifiedOperand returns the value of this operand fully simplified getSimplifiedOperand returns the operand in a form that can be materialized into bytecode if it cannot be completely optimized away The value is used during optimizations and propagated through the IR But it is thrown away after that But the operand form is used for constructing the compound objects represented by the operand Example a = 1 b = 34 c = ab d = 2c getValuec = 134 getSimplifiedOperandc = 1 b getValued = 2134 getSimplifiedOperandd = 2 c Note that abcd are all objects and c has a reference to objects a and b and d has a reference to c So if contents of a or b is modified the simplified values of c and d also change!

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here starts the logic for the class definition
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here starts the logic for the class definition
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here the actions to divide a region
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here the max line length == original line size so it doesnt get trimmed of white space
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we are actually violating the test independance since we keep the DetailsPane from test to test The reason to do this is to make it possible to run the tests with less memory requirements Hopefully someone might eventually fix the DetailsPane so that it is garbage collected properly and this is no longer needed see junitframeworkTestCasesetUp 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we can either revert any unchanged files in a changelist or any files regardless of whether they have been changed or not The whole process also accepts a p4 filespec 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we catch any EvalError from the interpreter because we are using it as a tool to load the command not as part of the execution path 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we change the AffineTransform so we can draw the annotation to a larger area and scale it down into the display area afterwards the original transform is restored
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we check that the average marker will in fact be visible before drawing it

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we check that the average marker will in fact be visible before drawing it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we check that the average marker will in fact be visible before drawing it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we create an anonymous exception type used for unrolling the stack MRI creates a new one for every call to timeout which can be costly We opt to use a single exception type for all cases to avoid this overhead
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we do a check to see if the user is installing the Legacy theme and reset the bar painters in that case
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we do not bother with the discriminator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we do the Replacement
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we dont want to suspend the tx If we do 1 We might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes No tx == no WL on cache node so other threads can prematurely see those query results 2 No tx == immediate replication More overhead plus we spread issue 1 above around the cluster
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we get the new mailboxinfo for the folder
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we have seen an odd number of backslashs followed by a u
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we have two possibilities 1 the propertyname matches the explicitly identifier property name 2 the propertyname matches the implicit id property name
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we located the new classifier with its operation 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we need to update the UI for the popup menu if the panel has one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated For partial component generation we currently just reselect the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we successfully loaded the class or failed
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we use BooleanUtilities to remain compatible with JDKs < 14
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Here we use index inside of column names so that we dont have to alias the columns in the dialect Different dialects call these sequence information columns by different names Just make sure to preserve the order in the dialect lastvalue maxvalue minvalue cachevalue incrementby iscycled
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here we work under the following assumptions valid cases 1 datetime + something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions 2 datetime datetime always results in a DOUBLE 3 datetime something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions invalid cases 4 datetime + datetime 5 something other than datetime datetime 6 datetime any type 7 datetime any type 8 any type datetime doing so allows us to properly handle parameters as either the left or right side here in the majority of cases
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here wed parse the output from change o into submit i in order to support default change
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	here weve hit the second line of a multiline i18n stanza Just skip it were not that sophisticated

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I thought this prevented GC It doesnt But if two Sessions are open and one is closed the one left open looses key bindings For example the Arrow navigation keys getKeymapremoveBindings
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I tried 8000 for the max length of VARCHAR and ingres gives an exception cannot assign a value of type long varchar to a varchar field So I limit this field to 4000 for now the Ingres product documentation indicated that 32k was acceptable Ive tested 4k and it seems to work fine
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I tried the following for values under 8000 but I get Encountered unexpected exception line 1 You cannot assign a value of type long byte to a column of type byte varying Explicitly convert the value to the required type registerColumnTypeTypesVARBINARY 8000 byte varying$l
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I tried to use the length from the source database PostgreSQL which yielded 8192 for this test So the column def in FB was binarycolumn bit varying8192 Yet it gave me an exception that indicated truncation string data right truncation??? So for now go back to hardcoded maximal length registerColumnTypeTypesBINARY 2147000000bit varying$l
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I would love to compare this with 123456 but depending on the filesystems granularity it can take an arbitrary value Just assert the time has changed 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	I wrote the testcases in one java file because I want also to test the combined behaviour see end of the class

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If you are ever unluckyimprobable enough to get a stack overflow whilst sorting increase the following constant and try again In practice I have never seen the stack go above 27 elems so the following limit seems very generous 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if you cannot read it you wont be able to write it either
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If you dont do this you get all sorts of annoying warnings about a missing properties file However it seems to work just fine with default values Ultimately we should probably include a CatalogManagerproperties file in the ant jarfile with some default property settings See CatalogManagerjava for more details

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	implementation adapted from taskdefsChecksum thanks to Magesh for hint
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	implementation moved to JmeterKeystore as only that has the keyType info
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Implementation Note Unlike many of the interfaces to the model there is no control to force a single instance of an XmiReader This is to allow work objects generated by the implementation to be garbage collected when an XmiReader instance falls out of scope 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Implementation notes All of the methods in this class are currently readonly If update methods are included in the future they should be defined so that a single instance of JavaSamplerContext can be associated with each thread Therefore no synchronization should be needed The same instance should be used for the call to setupTest all calls to runTest and the call to teardownTest

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in an effort to avoid concurrentmodificationexceptions from potential recursive calls back through here as a result of the eventual call to PersistentCollectionendRead we scan the internal loadingCollections map for matches and store those matches in a temp collection the temp collection is then used to drive the endRead processing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	In an effort to avoid non JDBC standard out parameter types ie oracle specific ones the dbmsoutputgetline is used rather than the dbmsoutputgetlines The disadvantage is there are more trips to the server to return multiple lines

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	In spite of the name this is actually used to determine if the loop controller is repeatable The value is only used in nextIsNull when the loop end condition has been detected If forever==true then it calls resetLoopCount otherwise it calls setDonetrue Loop Controllers always set forever=true so that they will be executed next time the parent invokes them Thread Group sets the value false so nextIsNull sets done and the Thread Group will not be repeated However its not clear that a Thread Group could ever be repeated 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in Sybase DEFAULT keyword must appear prior to NULLNOT NULL
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	In that case first CfN will fail with CNFE and we will avoid UnsupportedClassVersionError

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in the following code barL0 is in Java2D coordinates the LEFT end of the bar for a horizontal bar chart and the TOP end of the bar for a vertical bar chart Whether this is the BASE of the bar or not depends also on a whether the data value is negative relative to the base value and b whether or not the range axis is inverted This only matters ifwhen we apply the minimumBarLength attribute because we should extend the nonbase end of the bar
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in the future it will be possible to also add new addresses
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in the future we will want something better eg having an evt object passed to EditActioninvoke
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	In the next line replacing makeEmptyProject by getCurrentProject fails the test except when run in Eclipse MVW I have no idea why
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	in the next zoomPointx and y replace by ex and y for now this helps to handle the mouse events and besides those values are unused AFAIK

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it can still be null if the UML element did not have a multiplicity defined
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It causes a lot of pain in serveral places to cope with nulls or emptys here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It contains a banned string
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It does not contain a required string

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is a property reference foobar
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is a removed file
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is a simple table alias foo
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is a UML element that is not a ModelElement
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is always thrown as said in Embedded Derby API So it is not error it is info
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is done
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is handy to have the cannonical path name to show user in error messages Since getting that name might involve an IOException we need to put it inside a try statement However since the file does exist there is no good reason for getting an IOException at this point but if we get one there is something seriously wrong and we want to abort Therefore it make sense to get that name here and save it for later use
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is HTML try to find out which charset from meta tag NB The seach for charset below is very simple It assumes that the meta tag to find is on ITS OWN LINE ie <meta can be found at the beginning of the line and all the content of the tag is found on the same line! Could be better but this is first shot 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is important to process the name change first so that we can use the new name instead of the old in subsequent alterations
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is not a bug
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is not possible to access the actual HTTP response code so we assume no data means failure
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is or was referenced somewhere
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is possible for a table to contain only columns of types that we cannot process or do selects on so check for that Since this check is on the structure of the table rather than the contents we only need to do it once ie it is not needed in getWarningOnProjectedUpdate
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is possible for this method to be called during flush processing so make certain that we do not accidently initialize an uninitialized proxy
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is quite possible that the cause of the problem has by now been deleted in which case we will throw an exception if we try to change things Catch this tidily
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is safe here to cast to AbstractMailFrameControlller
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is safe to give a null to the next function since a statemachine is always composed by a model anyhow 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is the combo for order
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is the JMeterThread which knows how to sample a real sampler
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is the most common post request with parameter name and values We also assume this if no content type is present to be most backwards compatible but maybe we should only parse arguments if the content type is as expected standard name=value postData
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It is the sub sampler of the transaction that will be sampled
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is too slow to look at every data item so lets just look at the first middle and last items

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it is unlikely that state will be null but check anyway
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it isnt possible to undo whatever the script did
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it just wont be added as a shutdown hook 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It looks better if the height increases too 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it might be an unwrapped collection reference! try to find a wrapper slowish
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it might still need to apply a collection ordering based on a manytomany defined orderby
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it must be a collection fetch
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it must be a proxied HTTPS request $NONNLS1$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It must be an unsettable feature to be empty and considered set 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It must be an unsettable feature to be null and considered set 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it refers to an alias of a projection
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It seems there was no implementation of our current target language so we just add one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it should never go here!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it was a boolean expression
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it was not embedded so the argument is just an id
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it was not found at all!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It was not found in the model class so check if primitive type 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It was the duplicate entry
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it will be null unless remoteStop = true
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it will not be done correctly if the first statement is omitted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	it wont hurt fixnums
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It would be better if we didnt need the container to get the target This constructor can have zero parameters as soon as we improve targetChanged
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It would be better if we didnt need the container to get the target This constructor can have zero parameters as soon as we improve targetChanged
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	It would be nice to tell the user what happened but if we try to put up a dialog box at this point we run into trouble in some cases where the field continually tries to reread after the dialog closes because it is being repainted

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Notation events are fired on the Swing event thread We assume that serializing on the final call is sufficient
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Notation events are likely to cause GEFSwing operations so we dispatch them on the Swing event thread as a convenience so that the receiving notationChanged methods dont need to deal with it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Notation settings are different since we know that at a minimum the isShowPath setting can change because with implement PathContainer so we make sure that we have a private copy of the notation settings

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE addDuplicateAlias already performs nullness checks on the alias
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note all fields are final rehash creates new entries when necessary as documented in javautilconcurrentConcurrentHashMapjava that will statistically affect only a small percentage < 20 of entries for a given rehash
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Although its not shown in the UML 14 spec a TemplateArgument appears to be a datavalue like MultiplicityRange and can not be reused in multiple instances The UML diagrams dont show it as a composition but it effectively is
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Although WFR 3 in section 21135 UseCase of the UML 14 spec says A UseCase cannot contain any Classifiers the OCL is actually selfcontents>isEmpty which would seem to imply it cant contain any elements tfm 20060416

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Because were using ASTUtilcreateParent the tree must be created from the bottom up IS EMPTY x => EXISTS QUERY SELECTFROM FROM x 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note bshmethod needs to reevaluate arg types here This is broken 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note bshmethod needs to reevaluate the method return type here This is broken 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note could cause overlaps in case ClassLoaderthisparent has matches
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Currently this optimization is limited to the following situations All expressions must be intranged literal fixnums It also still emits the code for the safe when logic which is rather wasteful since it essentially doubles each code body As such it is normally disabled but it serves as an example of how this optimization could be done Ideally it should be combined with the when processing to improve code reuse before its generally available
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note device != null > hierarchical
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note dirtyFields==null means we had no snapshot and we couldnt get one using selectbeforeupdate oldFields==null just means we had no snapshot to begin with we might have used selectbeforeupdate to get the dirtyFields
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note do not change this to BshClassManager plainClassForName or equivalent This class must not touch any other bsh classes 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note dont need to specify size or crc for compressed files

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE evict operates locally only ie does not propogate to any other nodes in the potential cluster This is exactly what is needed when we destroy here destroy is used as part of the process of shutting down a SessionFactory thus these removals should not be propogated
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note expected in the syntax type=listenerClass septype=listenerClass where sep is any whitespace or comma
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE firstRow is zerobased
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE firstRow is zerobased
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note fix has only noarg form but truncate allows optional parameter

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note If we are here cacheSchemaIndependentMetaData must be false
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE If we switch to a persistent repository like the btree repository well want to keep the old extents around
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note if we want methods declared inside blocks to be accessible via thismethodname inside the block we could handle it here as a special case See also resolveThisFieldReference special handling for BlockNameSpace case They currently work via the direct name eg methodName
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note Im using != to see if we got a new object back from the apply method
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note In Ruby 19 all of this logic can go away since they will require explicit bindings for evals
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note in this case parent must have a class manager
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note includes part of fix for JRUBY1339
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note initialised with error = failure = false
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note intentionally returning the actual array returned from Java rather than wrapping it in a RubyArray wave of the future when javaclass will return the actual class rather than a JavaClass wrapper
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note interface is assumed to already contain HibernateProxyclass

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note isRelative > hierarchical
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note it is a string and not a file to handle relativeabsolute otherwise a relative file will be resolved based on the current basedir
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note it is conceptually possible that a UserType could map null to a nonnull value so the following is arguable
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note it may see like with the new 13 scoping this test could be removed but it cannot When recurse is false we still need to set the variable in our parent not here 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note its important to scan the items BEFORE we make the Unmatched file map because that creates a bunch of NEW folders and files unattached to repository and we dont want to include those in our traversal
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note its important to scan the items BEFORE we make the UnmatchedFileMap because that creates a bunch of NEW folders and files unattached to repository and we dont want to include those in our traversal
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note its ok to cache class resolution here because when the class space changes the namespace will discard cached names
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note its okay for two URIs to share a segments array since neither will ever modify it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE kirkradikcom 04April2001 If you put in the s you have to start running through regular expressions here Much easier to just not include the scripting information than to try to add it and strip it later
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note matchgroups includes group 0
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE max 1 because first is zerobased while max is not
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note MRI has a very nontrivial way of calculating the precision so we use very simple approximation here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE MRIs sqrt precision is limited by 100 but we allow values more than 100
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note nemesgamma can return DoublePOSITIVEINFINITY or DoubleNEGATIVEINFINITY when value is an integer less than 1 We treat 0 as a special case to avoid Domain error 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE No longer a separate type in UML 21
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note no way to mutate the Throwable message must maintain our own
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note Only used by compiler until it can use getConstant again or use some other refactoring 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note originally the code did use the ClientPool to share subscribers however since the key was this and each sampler is unique nothing was actually shared
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note performExecutions clears all collectionXxxxtion collections the collection actions in the session
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note position of these elements in the menu must match the corresponding ProxyControlGROUPING values $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note query != null > hierarchical
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE responseData encoding is server specific Therefore we do byte > unicode > byte conversion to ensure UTF8 encoding as required by XPathUtil convert unicode String > UTF8 bytes $NONNLS1$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note segmentShift differs from ConcurrentHashMaps calculation due to issues with SystemidentityHashCode upper n bits always 0 at least under Java 16 WinXP
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note segmentslength > 0 > hierarchical
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note segmentslength > 0 > hierarchical
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Serialization is primarily supported for testing purposes and there is no general guarantee that serialization will work correctly Specifically instance variables pointing at symbols threads modules classes and other unserializable types are not detected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note SessionInternalFrame and SQLinternalFrame should never provide a ToolsPopupAccessor Their Tools Popup ist configured in the SyntaxPlugin class with standard Actions from ActionCollection
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE Since we are processing ASTs loop bodies are processed in depthfirst manner with outer loops encountered before inner loops and inner loops finished before outer ones So we can keep track of loops in a loop stack which keeps track of loops as they are encountered This lets us implement nextredobreakretry easily for the nonclosure cases
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note some interesting things are going on here 1 We swap instead of push The primary mode of operation acts like we are in the enclosing namespace super must be preserved etc 2 We do not call the body block eval with the namespace override Instead we allow it to create a second subordinate BlockNameSpace child of the forNameSpace Variable propogation still works through the chain but the blocks child cleans the state between iteration which is correct Java behavior see forscope4bsh 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE SPECIAL CASE default to join and nonlazy for the second join of the manytomany
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE SPECIAL CASE onetoone constrained=false cannot be proxied so default to join and nonlazy
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note success = false because we dont know the outcome of the transaction
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note tabs and newlines are allowed in string fields even though they are unusual
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note tabs and newlines are allowed in string fields even though they are unusual
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note technically I think we could get by passing in only the current namespace or perhaps BshClassManager here instead of CallStack and Interpreter However lets just play it safe in case of future changes anywhere you eval a node you need these 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note Temporary events need to be included in case a modla dialog opens
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that a0=anp1=0
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that addMethod now does its own put so any change made to functionality here should be made there as well 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that all regexps start with A so they only match the start of the string
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that each iteration of the loop may add new elements
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that for consistency with the AWT implementation it is necessary to switch temporarily the foreground and background colours
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that for sequential scrolling we make the assumption that the first persister element is the root entity
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that for sequential scrolling we make the assumption that the first persister element is the root entity
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that if firstLine == lastLine loop does not execute
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that if we load this collection from a cartesian product the multiplicity would be broken so use an idbag instead
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that if were copying this element then we must also be allowed to copy other necessary objects
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that it might be better to iterate the snapshot but this is safe assuming the user implements equals properly as required by the Set contract!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that multiplicity is what is the notation is listening for in UML14 uppervalue are listened to in UML2 It is not currently why it is not required to register for lowerValue also
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that multiplicity is what is the notation is listening for in UML14 uppervalue are listened to in UML2 It is not currently why it is not required to register for lowerValue also
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that sampleStarted and sampleStopped is not made to appear in synch with sampleOccured when replaying held samples For now this is not critical since sampleStarted and sampleStopped is not used but it may become an issue in the future Then these events must also be stored so that replay of all events may occur and in the right order Each stored event must then be tagged with something that lets you distinguish between occured started and ended
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that string is deprecated
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that string place holder adjusts indentation to correct this trackAndReplace method is used below
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that the attribute has been specified
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that the copied tree should not be modified by wrapped ASTJField the copied tree will have source ranges for all nodes in the source file hence the get methods in the new ASTJField will not return the right contents
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that the filename is also used as a key to the pool if used Documents provided in the testplan are not currently pooled as they may change between samples 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that there is some debate over whether should be included
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that this object equality check is intentional to ensure the string and its interned version are the same object
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that WE CANT say the following because of the onthefly conversion of Fixnum to Long assertTruevalue == valueViaValuesIterator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that we dont define taskB1
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that we dont use setDirty because a that would send an unnecessary message b it would also set the AUTOSAVEDIRTY flag which will make the autosave thread write out a redundant autosave file
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note that we rely on the fact that when a physical line is invalidated all screen linessubregions of that line are invalidated as well See below comment for code that tries to uphold this assumption
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note that well potentially see the refs for both the java object and proxy whichever we see first will cause the entry to be removed
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE The <XMIheader><XMIheader> is provided for us
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note the element is a ConfigTestElement so cannot use FTPSampler access methods
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note the file panel already includes the error logging checkbox so we dont have to add it explicitly
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE The five match methods are aritysplit to avoid the cost of boxing arguments when theres already a cached match Do not condense them into a single method
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE The indicies here match exactly the signal values
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note the item name is used by ChangeLanguage to create a Locale for that language so need to ensure that the language strings are valid If they exist use the Locale language constants Also need to ensure that the names are valid resource entries too 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note the resource string wont respond to localechanges however this does not matter as it is only used when pasting to the clipboard
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note the start of this subexpression
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE there are two rows NOTE MssqlConstraint holds the columns in the table participating in the key NOTE ForeignKeyConstraint holds the columns in the referenced table IN THE SAME ORDER 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note theres 3 capturing groups per value
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note these assertions imply that neither this nor the base URI has a relative path thus both have either an absolute path or no path
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE These must stay in this order to match rendering styles
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note this affects the return value!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE this assumes something about how propertySelectFragment is implemented by the subclass!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this class is final because we may test == Primitiveclass in places If we need to change that search for those tests 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this field and the following static initializer must be located be in this order!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this is an instance field and is not transient so is created by the JMeter client and propagated to the server instance by RMI a static field would be recreated on the server and would pick up the server properties $NONNLS1$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE this is being used from the process of shutting down a SessionFactory Specific things to consider 1 this clearing of the region should not propagate to other nodes on the cluster if any this is the cachemodelocal option bit 2 really just trying a best effort to cleanup after ourselves lock failures etc are not critical here this is the failsilently option bit
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE this is not updated when properties are fetched lazily!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this is only used to implement TestIterationListenertestIterationStart Since this is a frequent event it makes sense to create the list once rather than scanning each time The memory used will be released when the thread finishes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE This is package scope to force callers to use ResourceLoaderWrapper
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE This listener needs to always be active even if this tab isnt visible
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE This may be called from a different thread so we need to be careful of the threading restrictions imposed by AbstractDocument for mutators to be sure we dont deadlock
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE This may be called from a different thread so we need to be careful of the threading restrictions imposed by AbstractDocument for mutators to be sure we dont deadlock
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this method produces meaningful results only for RubyIO objects For everything else returns 0
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this simply constructs a raw SQLTOKEN representing the where fragment and injects this into the tree This works however it is probably not the best longterm solution At some point we probably want to apply an additional grammar to properly tokenize this where fragment into constituent parts focused on the operators embedded within the fragment
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this test will fail if a property is added or removed to any of the components used in the test files The way to solve this is to appropriately change the test file
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note this!!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE unlike all other Loaders this one is NOT multithreaded or cacheable!!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	note updates to joined tables cant be batched
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note UserParameterXML accesses this variable to obtain the Set data via method getParsedParameters
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note we assume members are ordered correctly already
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE we avoid joining to the next table if the named property is just the foreign key value
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note We cant use fileexists to check whether the symlink exists or not because that method returns false for existing but broken symlink So we try without the existence check but in the trycatch block MRI behavior symlink? on broken symlink should return true
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Note we change current frames visibility here because the methods which call this method are all fast eg they do not created their own frame
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE We have fit EOF and the block is not full! This is a broken archive It does not follow the standard blocking algorithm However because we are generous and it requires little effort we will simply ignore the error and continue as if the entire block were read This does not appear to break anything upstream We used to return false in this case Thanks to YohannRousselalcatelfr for this fix

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE we have to do this due to leftovers from other tests being causing strange errors when running in Eclipse
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NOTE we need to do the wrap here even if its not dirty because collections need wrapping but changes to them dont dirty the container Also for versioned data we need to wrap before calling searchForDirtyCollections

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle allows statement separators in PLSQL blocks The process of tokenizing above renders these procedure blocks as separate statements which is invalid for Oracle Since is the way in SQLPlus to denote the end of a procedure or function we reassemble any create procedurefunctiontrigger statements that we find This should be done before expanding file includes Otherwise any create sql found in files will already be joined causing this to find create SQL without matching The process of expanding file includes already joins the sql fragments that it finds
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle can only store DECIMAL type numbers Since regular nondecimal numbers appear as decimal Oracles decimal numbers can be rather large compared to other databases precision up to 38 Other databases can only handle this large precision in BIGINT fields not decimal so try to figure out if Oracle is really storing a BIGINT and claiming it is a DECIMAL If so convert the type to BIGINT before going any further
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle declares the column size to be 4000 regardless of the maximum length of the CLOB field So if the Oracle BLOBCLOB column contains values that exceed 4000 chars and we use colInfogetColumnSize we might create a destination column that is too small for the data that will be copied from Oracle We specify a default value of 4000 in case the table has no records or if the BLOBCLOB column contains only null values
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle did add support for ANSI CASE statements in 9i
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle doesnt allow unique bitmap indexes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Oracle driver reports to support getGeneratedKeys but they only support the version taking an array of the names of the columns to be returned via its RETURNING clause No other driver seems to support this overloaded version

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	PostgreSQL at least 732 returns false for supportsStoredProcedures even though it does support them
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	PostgreSQL follows the standard for SQL BIT Its a string of BITs So bit10 is a string of 10 bits JDBC treats SQL BIT as if it were only a single BIT It specifies that BIT is equivalent to BOOLEAN It claims that the PreparedStatement set method that should be used with BIT is setBoolean and getBoolean This is not compliant with the standard So SQL BIT type support is broken in Java there is nothing we can do about that Best thing to do for now is try to convert the BIT type to a boolean like the JDBC spec says and hope for the best Hope that the source database isnt using the BIT column as a sequence of multiple BITs

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since the flow layout is relatively straightforward no information needs to be recorded here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since the granularity of time in Java is only milliseconds add an adjustment so that the time is represented in 100s of nanoseconds The version number 1 is multiplexed into the most significant hex digit 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since the indices on the pop server start with 1 we add a dummy null for the 0 element in the list
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since the items are ordered we could be more clever here and avoid iterating over all the data
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since the letter wasnt a special letter this will be the first letter of our current column
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since the previous entry might have changed the color we need to reset the color back to default value for table cells taking into account whether the cell is selected or not
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since the result set cursor is always left at the first physical row after the last processed we need to jump back one position to get the key value we are interested in skipping
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since the user only wants to be notified of updates at startup return here thereby freeing up the thread
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since there are no buttons on this panel we have to set the size of the buttonpanel otherwise the title would not be aligned right 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since there is no way to compare the objects as equal we have to search through the list at this point
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since this entity will now be processed in the latest possible batch we can be assured that it will come after all other associations theres not need to continue checking
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since this is a complex polygon theres no easy way to resize it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since this is an explicit FROM element it cant be implied in the FROM clause
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since this is only used by clearRect we dont update the GC yet
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since this thread is not a UI thread it is ok to run the task synchronously
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since this timer must be started when SQuirreL is launched wait a couple of minutes for SQuirreL to get done initializing the UI
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since UML2 its easier TDs only via stereotypes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since UML2 this must appear before the isAClass clause
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since user is now using popup stop editing using the incell editor if any
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we are reading Metadata about the DB we should never see a BLOB If we do the contents are not interpretable by Squirrel so just tell the user that it is a BLOB and that it has data
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we are reading Metadata about the DB we should never see a CLOB However if we do we assume that it is printable text and that the user wants to see it so read in the entire thing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we arent sure of ordering fire event for whole table
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we can use a correlated subquery to update all rows in one statement we dont care about the set values unless fromTables is null in which case we go with a normal update Using the set values would require an update statement for each row in the merged table for each column that was merged in which is incredibly inefficient However the API is intended to support database dialects that cant handle correlated subqueries
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since we cannot do exact matches on floating point numbers we cannot use this field in the WHERE clause
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since we cannot do exact matches on floating point numbers we cannot use this field in the WHERE clause
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we depend upon the Connection class associated with the ISession we need to keep a reference to the ISession we are associated with However this session could be closed at which time we want to give up our reference so that it can be garbage collected 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we depend upon the Informixspecific IfmxConnection class we need to keep a reference to the ISession we are associated with However this session could be closed at which time we want to give up our reference so that it can be garbage collected 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since we did something we should check that there is nothing else to do before going back to sleep
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since we do not have all of the data from the clob we cannot allow editing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we dont have any other error reporting mechanism we add the error message as an alwaysfailing test to the test suite
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we dont have any other error reporting mechanism we add the error message as an alwaysfailing test to the test suite
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since we dont mangle extensions like the servlet does we need to check for keywords as class names
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we look ahead before adding theres one last env var
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we look ahead before adding theres one last env var
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we only use this right on an operation we always want to include the keyType and valueType and we never want to qualify the property names 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since we will do the processing recursively we need to ensure we dont stack overflow if there is a circular super type 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Since were invoking pluggedin code we must be defensive against cycles 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	since were not actually duping the incoming channel into our handler we need to copy the original sync behavior from the other handler

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	tell the rest of the world that the table has changed The fire method used here is very course it says that the whole table has been changed when really only one row has been added However finergrained methods did not seem to cause the right effect so Im using this one untill someone reports a problem with it Also if either of these notifications the actual model and the sortable model are eliminated it either throws an exception or does not update the GUI Go figure Finally the fire on the acutalModel is triggered from this method rather than from inside the MyJTable code because the add method used to add a row is also used when loading the table with lots of rows and in that case we do not want to generate events until all of the rows have been added so the fire cannot happen there

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	There are some fields that cannot be used in a WHERE clause either because there cannot be an exact match eg REAL FLOAT or because we may not have the actual data in hand BLOBCLOB or because the data cannot be expressed in a string form eg BINARY An update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row because we can only see the fields that we know how to do WHEREs on Therefore when we are updating them there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria we hope We determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the WHERE clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the WHERE clause Any field that can be used there will return something of the form <fieldName> = <value> and a field that cannot be used will return a null or zerolength string

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this call should succeed as unless overrides if
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This calls the getters to fetch actions even though the action variables are defined is instances of this class This is because any number of action getters could have been overridden in a descendant and it is the action from that overridden method that should be returned in the array
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This came from trial and error yielding decent results on all platforms It should be consistent with activate 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This can execute if there is an owner list and a collection and the owner list contains all the objects of the collection 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This can happen if a logtarget idref specifies a nonexistent target
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This can happen if an impl of ISQLExecutionListener returns null from the statementExecuting API method to indicate that the SQL shouldnt be executed

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this check for files without extension
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This check is needed otherwise the setbase below gives an exception
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This check is needed since processing leaves the cursor after the last physical row for the current logical row thus if we are after the last physical row this might be caused by either 1 scrolling to the last logical row 2 scrolling past the last logical row In the latter scenario the previous logical row really is the last logical row In all other cases we should process back two logical records the current logic row plus the previous logical row

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This class represents all Diagrams within ArgoUML It is based upon the GEF Diagram<p> It adds a namespace and the capability to delete itself when its namespace is deleted <p> TODO MVW I am not sure of the following<p> The namespace of the diagram is eg used when creating new elements that are shown on the diagram they will have their namespace set according this It is NOT necessarily equal to the owner <p> MVW I doubt all following The namespace of the diagram is eg used to register a listener to the UML model to be notified if this element is removed which will imply that this diagram has to be deleted too <p> Hence the namespace of eg a collaboration diagram should be the represented classifier or in case of a represented operation the classifier that owns this operation And the namespace of the statechart diagram should be the namespace of its statemachine

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this comment extract from JUnit Task may also apply here in VM is not very nice since it could probably hang the whole build IMHO this method should be avoided and it would be best to remove it in future versions TBD SBa
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This comment was included in a previous version before 12005 of the test which had this assertion commented out Interaction should not be removed when removing ClassifierRole maybe if the last message is removed from the interaction but even then its doubtfull since it will probably lead to backward compatibility problems in save formats but my reading of the UML 14 specification is that an Interaction without at least one message is definitely illegal so MDR is doing the right thing by removing it in this case where we only have a single message which then gets deleted tfm

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is package so check the package information if this is in cat file If it is then load the cat file into the tree thereby traversing it otherwise just traverse the tree 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is packageprivate so that the painter can use it without having to call getSelection which involves an array copy
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is perfectly normal and happens among other things within the call to setDiagram below
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is pretty inefficient for building an array so just raise an error if someones using it for a lot of elements
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is prone to infinite loops if replace string turns out empty
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is required so that see orgapachejmeterguitreeJMeterTreeModelgetNodesOfType can find the Clearable nodes the userObject has to implement the interface
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is responsible that comments are not in curQuery

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This lets us test whether the string exists as a file If not we try as a URI 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this line has been commented out return next line number
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this line is the start of a fold
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this line is the start of a fold
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this line triggers the defect
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This list is reduced because most search requests can be answered anyway using locally cached headerfields
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this loader was first but it didnt find it try the parent
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This looks wrong but its the way MRI does it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This loop is hammered during decompression hence avoid native method call overhead of Systemarraycopy for very small ranges to copy 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this loop runs parallel to the build
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This makes dragging connected edges very smooth see orgtigrisgefpresentationFiggetClosestPointjavaawtPoint 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this makes HyperSearch much faster
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This makes the text not touch the textborder line 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This map allows summarisers with the same name to contribute to the same totals 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This Map serves two purposes maps file names to containers ensures only one container per file across all threads 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This Map serves two purposes maps names to containers ensures only one container per file across all threads The key is the concatenation of the file name and the XPath string 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this may be a java14 thingy only

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This may be called either when the table is editable or when it is readonly When it is readonly there is no command to be saved but when it is editable there may be a command
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this may need mangling due to peeks
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This may return null
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This means no sample is saved
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This means the cookie was wrong for the URL

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this message doesnt exit in this folder anymore
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this message is already cached
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method assumes UTF8 input data
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method can be called only if theres a valid selection so go ahead and remove whatevers selected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This Method delivers the next line
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method exists for us to break up multiple expression when nodes eg when 123 into individual whenNodes The primary reason for this is to ensure lazy evaluation of the arguments when foobargar to prevent sideeffects In the old code this was done using nested when statements which was awful for interpreter and compilation Notes This has semantic equivalence but will not be lexically equivalent Compiler needs to detect same bodies to simplify bytecode generated 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This Method frees a given String from Comments defined in Rfc822 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method handles patterns and delegates to fnmatchhelper for the main work
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method has JITed already or has been abandoned Bail out
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method has severe consequences on performance We cannot rely on the superhashCode method since supergetName always return the empty string in the current implemention theres no setter so it is basically draining the performance of a hashmap lookup
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is a noop if there is a Synchronization!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called from a thread In case listeners update Swing controls we invoke later here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is called from the super classs constructor therfore titleLbl is null for that call

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called to build arguments for a block!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called to build assignments for a multipleassignment instruction
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called when a cell value is edited by the user
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is called when a new nonnull collection is persisted or when an existing nonnull collection is moved to a new owner
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called when editing is completed It must return the new value to be stored in the cell
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is called whenever the month or year changes Its job is to repaint the labels and determine whether any selection range limits have been reached 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is CPU intensive and therefore needs to be as efficient as possible 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is for finalizers registered via ObjectSpace
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is intended only for defining new classes in Ruby code so it uses the allocator of the specified superclass or default to the Object allocator It should NOT be used to define classes that require a native allocator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is intended only for defining new modules in Ruby code
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is invoked from several places so we have to check whether if the project uri is set or not
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method is overridden in order to ignore change of the y coordinate during dragging see orgtigrisgefpresentationFigNodesuperTranslateint int 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method makes the web service call If you want to you can create a web service proxy from the WSDL file 9 times out of 10 thats what you really want to do
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method may be called many times!!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method might get called at startup
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method must be overridden if you want to display images
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method should be implemented assuming its valid to do startstopstart leave state appropriate for another start
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method should parallel findMostSpecificMethod 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method takes as input a map of operands to their values and outputs If the value map provides a value for any of the instructions operands this method is expected to replace the original operands with the simplified values It is not required that it do so code correctness is not compromised by failure to simplify 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method takes as input a map of operands to their values and outputs the result of this instruction If the value map provides a value for any of the instructions operands the expectation is that the operand will be replaced with the simplified value It is not required that it do so code correctness is not compromised by failure to simplify param valueMap Mapping from operands to their simplified values returns simplified result output of this instruction 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method uses Apache soap util to create the proper DOM elements return Element 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this might be a bit slow if char occurs a lot
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This might be because an table alias is used maybe with an AS before it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This might be invalid or an IPv4address If its potentially an IPv4address backup to just after the last valid character that matches hexseq
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This might be invalid or an IPv4address If its potentially an IPv4address backup to just after the last valid character that matches hexseq

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This next argument may be used to switch off the generation of sequence numbers this is still to be implemented They are less desired in sequence diagrams since they do not add any information In collaboration diagrams they are needed and they are still optional in sequence diagrams 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This next line presumes that the 1st fig with this owner is the previous port and consequently nullifies the owner of this 1st fig

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this one is here because the changes to support ResourceCollections have broken Magics JUnitTestTask The task adds a FileSet to a BatchTest instance using the Java API and without telling the FileSet about its project instance The original code would pass in project on the call to getDirectoryScanner which is now hidden deep into Resourcesiterator and not reachable
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This one is still usable so lets retain it 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this one needed only for guessEntityMode
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this one only finds public and in interfaces etc
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this one only really needed for badlybehaved applications! if the TransactionManager has a Sychronization registered its a noop actually we do need it for downgrading locks

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	to allow the fw to save and reload user options related to specific columns we construct a unique name for the table so the column can be associcated with only that table Some drivers do not provide the catalog or schema info so those parts of the name will end up as null Thats ok since this string is never viewed by the user and is just used to distinguish this table from other tables in the DB We also include the URL used to connect to the DB so that the same tableDB on different machines is treated differently

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	to avoid having to deal with readwrite locks and such we insert the loaded data into the buffer in the postload cleanup runnable which runs in the AWT thread
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	to avoid our skip table having a length of 2 ^ 16 we hash each character of the input into a character in the alphabet x00xFF using the lower 8 bits of the characters value resulting in a more reasonable skip table of length 2 ^ 8 the result of this is that more than one character can hash to the same index but since the skip table encodes the position of occurence of the character furthest into the string with a particular index whether or not it is the only character with that index an index collision only means that that this heuristic will give a suboptimal skip ie a complete skip table could use the differences between colliding characters to maximal effect at the expense of building a table that is over 2 orders of magnitude larger and very sparse

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Unlike WeakHashMap our Entry does not subclass WeakReference but rather makes it a final field The theory is that doing so should force a happensbefore relationship WRT the WeakReference constructor guaranteeing that the key will be visibile to other threads unless its been GCed See JLS 175 final fields and 1745 Happensbefore order to confirm or refute my reasoning here

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are forking here to be sure that if JspC calls Systemexit it doesnt halt the build
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are getting events we dont want Filter them out
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are going to add the ones still valid new ones in the right sequence
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are going to scan everything anyway

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are limiting some things if the string we have is less than the limit then we are ok and do not need to reread because we already have the whole thing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are looking first to match with 3 different constructor types We would not expect a Fig to have any mix of these Any constructor other than these should be deprecated so we look for these first FigDiagramEdgeSettings DiagramSettings FigObject Rectangle DiagramSettings FigRectangle DiagramSettings
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are near the middle so well start by trying to do a drop on 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are not generating the manifest file if the pluginxml exists 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We are not interested in the name 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are now at a new tree level
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are on a dos style system so this path could be a drive spec We look at the next token
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are on NetWare tokenizing is handled a little differently due to the fact that NetWare has multiplecharacter volume names
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are only interested on subscription requests
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are playing some games with the lexer for efficiency we could just create a new lexer each time here but instead we will just reset it so that it thinks it is starting at the beginning of the document but reporting a funny start colorStartPos Reseting the lexer causes the close method on the reader to be called but because the close method has no effect on the DocumentReader we can do this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we are presumably running a precompiled class

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We arent able to resize neither the top bound from the first region nor the bottom bound from the last region 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we arent fully defined yet this is an error unless we are in an antlib in which case the resource name is determined automatically NB URIs in the ant core package will be at this point
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we assum super is always initialized to allzero matrix so the total sum should be 0 upon initialization However we set it to DoubleMINVALUE to get the same effect and yet avoid division by 0 upon initialization 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We assume here that if the pseudoColumn was used in the query then it was likely to have caused the SQLException If not length == 0 then retrying the query wont help just throw the exception
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We assume profile is contained in a single extent
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We assume that classes and attributes wont be in the same completion list Classes will be completed fully qualified when the user works with fully qualified class names 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We assume that everything jikes writes goes to standard output not to standard error The option Xstdout that is given to Jikes in JavacdoJikesCompile should guarantee this At least I hope so

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we assume user cancelled search > remove cached command
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We attempt to put in the MAP and Schema files of CMP beans
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We break if we know this sleep was explicitly woken upinterrupted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We build a set of lists each list contains plugin menu items that begin with a given letter
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We call getKeyFromResultSet here so that we can know the key value upon which to perform the breaking logic However it is also then called from getRowFromResultSet which is certainly not the most efficient But the call here is needed and there currently is no other way without refactoring of the doQuerygetRowFromResultSet methods
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We call liasonconfigure and then liaisonsetStylesheet so that the internal variables of liaison can be set up
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we call parse with 1 to get only one this also means if we change the implementation to use 2 it would use every other entry and so on Not that it is really useful but a person could use it that way if they have a huge gigabyte log file and they only want to use a quarter of the entries
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we call refresh ticks just to get the maximum width or height
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can also optimize single valued reverse 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can also optimize single valued reverse

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can create the RemoveCommand for an uncontrol but we must defer creating an AddCommand to control until run when the user specifies a target resource 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can delete figs like figrects now too
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can distinguish between 4 cases 1 A trigger is given None exists yet 2 The trigger was present and it is the same type or a different type and its text is changed or the same 3 A trigger is not given None exists yet 4 The name of the trigger was present but is removed The reaction in these cases should be 1 Find the referred trigger issue 5988 or create a new one and hook it to the transition 2 Rename the trigger 3 Nop 4 Unhook and erase the existing trigger 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can do nothing if we dont have both the use case and extension point
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can do the cast since orphandelete does not apply to 1 newly instantiated collections 2 arrays we cant track orphans for detached arrays
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can enable the action as indicated by the command and we can set all the other values from the command 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can give up looking if weve hit both criteria
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can go straight to the first required row
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can have more than one file in the string so tokenize on whitespace Let the user know if we find multiple tokens that they cannot place drop than one file at a time
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can inner join to superclass tables the row MUST be there we can never inner join to subclass tables
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can just use dt since it is immutable
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can not optimize
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can not optimize
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can not remove this and have the application manage things directly based on the font since only the names should be bold
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can only move a single node
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can reset and try a drop insert instead 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we can reuse it for each row
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can safely reference methods here instead of doing getMethods since if we are adding we are not using a IncludedModuleWrapper
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can try to do a drop on instead 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can use == for EObjects and EnumLiterals

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We can use the Java way to maximize the window
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cannot delete the last diagram

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cannot mock DTProperties because it is designed to be accessed statically Simulate missing property
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cannot set the body of this model element type
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cannot set the priority here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cannot use an iterator here because the close method manipulates the list
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cannot use this data in the WHERE clause if it has been truncated Since being truncated is the same as needing to reread only use this in the WHERE clause if we do not need to reread
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cant assign null to primitive types
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant batch joined inserts especially not if it is an identity insert nor can we batch statements where the expectation is based on an output param
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant be sure of the order
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cant blindly cache the genModel since we need to support moving the GenPackage to another container but the cast is expensive so wed like to do it no more than absolutely necessary 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant cascade to nonembedded elements
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cant change the TM on a running cache
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant do anything
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant do anything

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cant update any properties via just a URL connection
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we cant use the following valueOf method because it wont compile with JDK14 thiscolorsPoolgetIntegervalueOfawtColorgetRGB
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We cant want to do encoding of platform resource URIs by default yet 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We capture the original new and make it private
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we check length == 0 for load which does not use load path
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we check length == 0 for load which does not use load path
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we check the class type above
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we check the count to see if we have exceeded the number of lines to parse Theres no way to know where to stop in the file Therefore we use break to escape the while loop when weve reached the count

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we clean the line to get rid of extra stuff
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we clean up the ResultCollector to make sure theres no slow leaks
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We clear the saverequired flag on the Swing event thread in the hopes that it gets done after any other background work listener updates that is being done there
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we clone the chart because presumably there can be some delay between putting this instance on the system clipboard and actually having the getTransferData method called
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We clone to avoid enabling existing node
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We compare three classes plain md5 and popbeforesmtp
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we could check for base class of the stereotype but the condition normally covers it all
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We could let a String fall through to final input but since its the most likely input type we check it first
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We could make this expectation more restrictive currently However we might have impls that have wildly different queries in the future We dont want to sacrifice flexibility to use this test for a perceived benefit of mirroring the current implementations
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We could not find all of them print out first one we could print them all?
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We could probably also detect if LHS value came out of cache and avoid some of this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we could regerate this inside each called method!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We could register the session against the transaction even though it is not started but wed have no guarentee of ever getting the map entries cleaned up aside from spawning threads
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we could tell user here that export was canceled but I dont think its necessary and that avoids forcing user to do yet another annoying mouse click
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we create a fileset with the source file this lets us combine our logic for handling output directories mapping etc
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we create a new but empty chartMouseListeners list
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we create a stream tokenizer for parsing a simple stackbased language
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we create an event with a special flag setthe purpose of this is to communicate to the plot the default receiver of the event that series visibility has changed so the axis ranges might need updating

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we create an event with a special flag setthe purpose of this is to communicate to the plot the default receiver of the event that series visibility has changed so the axis ranges might need updating
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We create one extra dynamicScope on a binding so that when we eval b=1 binding the b will get put into this new dynamic scope The original scope does not see the new b and successive evals with this binding will I take it having the ability to have succesive binding evals be able to share same scope makes sense from a programmers perspective One crappy outcome of this design is it requires Dynamic and Static scopes to be mutable for this one case
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We create the post body content now so we know the size
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We create the post body content now so we know the size
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we created the document
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we currently only support a single category per activity
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We define an actual list to get around bug in java integration 1387115
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We depart here from strict adherence to MRI code as MRI uses Csprintf in part to format numeric output while well use Javas numeric formatting code and our own
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we did not find a collection element in the result set so we ensure that a collection is created with the owners identifier since what we have is an empty collection
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We did not replace the entry so use the existing one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we didnt find the key
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we didnt find the key
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we didnt get an exception so all is good
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we didnt have a component previously so create a border
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We didnt match a ResourceLocation but since we only support PUBLIC and URI entry types internally it is still possible that there is another entry in an external catalog that will match We call Apache resolvers resolveEntity method to cover this possibility 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We didnt match a ResourceLocation but since we only support PUBLIC and URI entry types internally it is still possible that there is another entry in an external catalog that will match We call Apache resolvers resolveEntity method to cover this possibility 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dispose resources we own but user must dispose gc
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do a quick check to see if any filters are set If not we just return false to be efficient
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do a write lock so that the autosave which grabs a read lock is not executed between the deletion of the autosave file and clearing of the dirty flag
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do abrevs ourselfs in the DocumentListener in NetbeansSQLEntryPanel We dont use the Netbeans implementation mainly because it is case sensitive If we come across a performance problem one day we can still try to use this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do both writable and writablereal through the same method because in our java process effective and real userid will always be the same
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do have another slash
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do not actually propogate ANTLRExceptions as a cause so log it here for diagnostic purposes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do not actually propogate ANTLRExceptions as a cause so log it here for diagnostic purposes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do not expect a lot of files in this directory so just do things linearly
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do not have to worry about queued additions to uninitialized collections since they can only occur for inverse collections!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not know the char set of the file to be uploaded so we set it to null
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not know the content encoding of the query string
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not know what the char set of the file is
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not look for an existing join on the same path because it makes sense to join twice on the same collection role

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do not use the sun impl for portability and always use our own implementation for consistent testing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not want to capture cached methods
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do not want to diagnose any error that have already been diagnosed by a super type

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do this bc maketmpname might be overridden
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we do this here instead of adding buffers to the bus
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We do this stuff because the browser is not able to handle more than one request yet 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont add a listener to a button twice because the FindDialogSupport class will call this method with the same button instances whenever the replace dialog is opened If we add the listener again and again replace will be done as often as the dialog is opened This is especially nasty if the text to replace is part of the replacement text
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont append + since Java number parser gets confused
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont care
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont care about the value just want to see if it throws
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont care if optional modules arent found 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont care if optional modules arent found 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont care if these throw an SQLException Just squelch them and report to the user what the outcome of the previous statements were
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont clone the listeners
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont consider secondary stuff
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont create an iterator stack until the root mapping itself has been returned by next once After that the stack should be nonempty and the top iterator should yield true for hasNext
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont create an iterator stack until the root mapping itself has been returned by next once After that the stack should be nonempty and the top iterator should yield true for hasNext 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont deal with negatives
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont destroy the timer when theres nothing happening because it would mean a lot more work on every single AWT event that gets dispatched

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont know anything about the ordering of the xvalues but we can still skip any trailing values that fall outside the range

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont know how many entries will be skipped
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont know if this type can be used in where clauses so always exclude it

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont need to care for duplicates here Pathlist does it for us
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont need to check for running commands here because there arent any shutdown plugins only use this thread
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont need to encode here because the only platform resource URIs in the map are for projects whose names are the same as corresponding plugin IDs and hence never need to be encoded see EcorePlugincomputePlatformResourceToPlatformPluginMap 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont need to issue a additional NOOP here since the ensureLogin call above ensures also the correct Status in a MINIDLE interval timeframe
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont need to worry about any condition in the ON clause here toFromFragmentString since anything in the ON condition is already applied to the whole query
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont need to worry about existing version being uninitialized because this block isnt called by a reentrant load reentrant loads always have lock mode NONE
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont need two identical shortcuts
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont recalculate activations just move them
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont stub return because we want to verify that the object filter was actually used
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont support so but some stdlib require so directly replace it with jar to look for an extension type we do support
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont support switching the entry control during a session because serveral things that are attached to the entry control from outside this plugin would need to reinitialze too For example code completion and edit extras synchronized session ISQLEntryPanelFactory factory = plugingetSQLEntryAreaFactory ISQLEntryPanel pnl = factorycreateSQLEntryPanelsession sessiongetSQLPanelAPIplugininstallSQLEntryPanelpnl

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we dont want interrupt to try disconnection again We dont want to continue using this connection even if KeepAlive is set May not exist
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont want keyType and valueType on a map type specification in a package interface But we also use qualified model information when defining a feature with suppressed get accessor on the interface and we do want to include these properties in that case

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We dont want to use CacheManager clone but the parent one and CacheManager is Thread Safe

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We first run a DFS based sort using each root as a starting node This creates the minimum sequence of Targets to the root nodes We then do a sort on any remaining unVISITED targets This is unnecessary for doing our build but it catches circular dependencies or missing Targets on the entire dependency tree not just on the Targets that depend on the build Target

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we have the form trimtrimSource so we trim leading and trailing spaces EARLY EXIT!!!!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We have the JBCWriteMutex so no other local thread will be trying to write this key Its possible here some remote thread has come in and changed the values again but since we are reading the values to write to JBC right now we know we are writing the latest values ie we dont assume that what we cached in entryupdate above is what we should write to JBC now Our write could be redundant ie we are writing what some remote thread just came in an wrote There is a chance that yet another remote thread will update us and well then overwrite that later data in JBC But all remote nodes will ignore that change in their localCache the only place it will live will be in JBC where it can only effect the initial state transfer values on newly joined nodes ie populateLocalCache
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We have the loader which is being used to load the CatalogResolver Can it see the ApacheResolver? The base resolver will only be able to create the ApacheResolver if it can see it doesnt use the context loader

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we know only the rhshand type so use that
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We know that dynselector must be nonnull if no error message

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we know that nameendsWithclass
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We know that URL arguments should always be encoded in UTF8 according to spec
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We know the column names all exist so create the config

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We lazily initialize this in case Readlinereadline has been overridden in ruby sreadline

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We look backwards
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We look backwards
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We look forward
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we look through the classpath elements If the element is a dir we look for the file IF it is a zip we look for the zip entry
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we look through the source path elements If the element is a dir we look for the file If it is a zip we look for the zip entry This isnt normal for source paths but we get it for free
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we make the clip region slightly larger than the dataArea so that the clipped edges dont show lines on the chart
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we mark the file to be deleted on exit the alternative would be to cache the filename and delete after execution finished which is much better for longlived runtimes though spawning complicates things
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we may have more than one statement in sql at this point
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We may need to subtract addition offset off of first 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we might have been closed as a result of the above

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We must have a qualifier for an attribute that needs qualified 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We must have a qualifier for an attribute that needs qualified 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we must iterate through this in descending order to avoid removing say item 2 making item 4 into item 3 inadvertently removing item 5 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we must keep two lists since other classes may modify the filesets Vector it is package private without us noticing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We must return a valid RDMSRSA command from this method to prevent RDMSRSA from issuing ERROR 400
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We must return a valid RDMSRSA command from this method to prevent RDMSRSA from issuing ERROR 400
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We must set res to null now before sending the event for the transaction so that we can ignore that event in our sampleOccured method
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we must use the remembered uk value since it is not available from the EntityEntry during assembly
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need a different value of initialFoldLevel here!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need a method operation implementation to store the method body
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need a place to store the color the JLabel should be returned to after its foreground and background colors have been set to the selection background color These ivars will be made protected when their names are finalized
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need at least 3 points to spline Draw simple line for two points
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need at least two points to draw something
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need character encoding aware printing here So using PrintWriter over OutputStreamWriter instead of PrintStream
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need full traces use default slow populator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need IMAPFlags
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need our tm so get it now and avoid doing other work if there is a problem
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need the edge to be complete
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need the trycatch just to keep the compiler happy
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need the wrapper not the item provider to handle a DragAndDropCommand the move add remove etc commands that implement it will have their values unwrapped as usual 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need these initializations very early on
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need this buffer because this method may be called asynchronously to the event dispatch thread What could happen is that currentAliasInfos ist changed
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need this for the focus manager
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need this in order to allow the user to see this plugin which isnt loaded in the plugin summary dialog so that they can enable it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need this loop in order to be able to unblock the join call without actually calling interrupt
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need this method to satisfy one of the Interfaces we implement but since we have moved all operations to the DataType subpanels which initialize their own data during creation there is nothing for us to do here

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need this public not protected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to add a second column to have a unique constraint so that we can drop that one Progress doesnt allow the very first index to ever be dropped
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to add this jar to the list for this class
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be careful that the proxy may be resolved while we are attaching this adapter We need to avoid attaching the adapter during the resolve and also attaching it again as we walk the eContents later Checking here avoids having to check during addAdapter 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be careful that we dont end up requiring the no namespace package just because the feature is unqualified 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be careful that we dont end up requiring the no namespace package just because the feature is unqualified 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is builtin and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to build the hashtable dynamically
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to call the supernext instead of thisnext which is done in GenericController because if we call thisnext it will return the TransactionSampler and we do not want that We need to get the next real sampler or controller
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to check canExecute here in case prepare went down the optimize path 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to check canExecute in case optimize is true 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to check even if it was not initialized because of delayed adds!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to close the out since some processes would just wait for the stream to be closed before they process its content and produce the output Eg cat
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to collect all methods though well only install the ones that are named in this class
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to collect all methods though well only install the ones that are named in this class
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to convert to a different format default to hex
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to determine the best way to know that two joinables represent a single manytomany
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to dirty check collections since they can cause an owner version number increment
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to dirty check manytoones with notfound=ignore in order to update the cache not the database since in this case a null entity reference can lose information
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to ensure that the variable names generated here cannot conflict with ruby variable names! Hence the tthat is appended to the beginning!

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity insertsupdates in order to account for bidi associations
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need to obtain the lock before any actions are executed since this may be an inverse=true bidirectional association and it is one of the earlier entity actions which actually updates the database this action is resposible for secondlevel cache invalidation only
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to parse get message with UID

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we needed to get this far even for invisible items to ensure that seriesPath updates happened but now there is nothing more we need to do for nonvisible items

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we never need to apply locks to the SQL
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we no longer have any dirs using this extended attribute

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only build caches if none were passed in Passing in caches counts as a clear statement of exactly what is wanted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only cache entire physical lines at once dont want to split a physical line into screen lines and only have some valid 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only check the length of the result Comparing the actual result outtoByteArray==original will usually fail because the order of the properties within each test element may change Comparing the lengths should be enough to detect most problem cases
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we only check the version when upgrading lock modes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we only close out if its the slave stream to avoid closing a directlymapped stream from parent process
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we only collect methods and interfaces for userdefined proxy classes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only define one special dynamic scope per logical binding So all bindings for the same scope should share the same dynamic scope This allows multiple evals with different different bindings in the same scope to see the same stuff

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only want IO objects with valid streams better to error now 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only want IO objects with valid streams better to error now 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only want the index sql which is the second statement in the array Informix requires the constraint stuck onto the end of the statement
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We organise the data with the following assumption 1 the data are sorted by x then y 2 that the data will be represented by a rectangle formed by using xi+1 x yj+1 and y 3 we march along the yaxis at the same value of x until a new value x is found at which point we will flag the index where xi+1<>xi
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We override that the logic which uses this

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We presume that the container equals this PropPanel

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We really should never get here because eval will throw an exception if xpath is invalid but whatever better safe
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We really shouldnt add it until after it is set up but we need it to have an owner for the following method calls
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we recalculate all the activations
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we recalculate all the activations

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We removed the last partition so now remove the pool too 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We represent a fromclause alias
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we represent a naked simple propref

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We see that the replacement was already done before so we can count this as replaced
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we set all Java methods to optional since manymost have overloads

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we should make this configurable eventually
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we should make this configurable eventually
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we should never get here because the areEqual function is only called when we are trying to update the database so we know that we have a DataType object for this column or we would have been stopped from editing by the isEditableXXX methods but we need a return here to keep the compiler happy
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We should never NOT have an object here because we only get here when a DataType object has claimed that the column is editable If there is no DataType for the column then the default in the isEditableXXX methods in this class is to say that the column is not editable and therefore we should never have this method called in that case
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We should not have a query string part
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We should only evalute the condition if it is the first time first iteration we are called For subsequent calls we are inside the IfControllerGroup so then we just pass the control to the next item inside the if control
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We should use the current object state ie after any updates that occurred during flush
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We shouldnt get here but just in case We want a wide exception catcher to make sure our transaction always gets ended

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we suppress shadow generation because PDF is a vector format and the shadow effect is applied via bitmap effects
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we suppress shadow generation because SVG is a vector format and the shadow effect is applied via bitmap effects
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we take the first method found as our n method since for any nonspecific arity theyll all error the same If an actual n method is created we use that
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We test their relationship either via them both being classes 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we tokenize using double quotes this means for tomcat we should have 3 tokens if there isnt any additional information in the logs
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we totally failed to stop the test
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We treat the feature as volatile if it is volatile itself or if it is a reference whose opposite end is volatile unless that opposite volatile reference delegates to a feature map in which case a full implementation of the references can be generated

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we use a custom JRadioButton subclass that returns false for isFocusTraversable so that the user can tab from the search field to the replace field with one keystroke
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use a different delegate than the nonoptimistic superclass default
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use a LinkedBlockingQueue rather than a ConcurrentLinkedQueue because it has a pollwithwait method that avoids the need to use a polling loop 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use a TreeMap because we need the entries to be sorted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use file test since it is faster than a stat
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use FILE versus IO to match TFILE in MRI 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use multi even for a single line because we want to respond to the enter key 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use multiline mask so can prefix the line with ^ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS2$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use multipart if we have been told so or files are present and the files should not be send as the post body
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use null here instead of because an attribute without a prefix is considered to have the null target namespace
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use offset here to keep track of extra newlines for windows
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we use SwingUtilitiesinvokeLater so that the action is executed before the popup is hidden
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we use the assumed value if there is one to avoid hitting the database
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use the attributes and flags from the cache but the parsed header from the parsed message
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use the default character set encoding of the JRE
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use the default character set encoding of the JRE

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We use the page encoding where the form resides as the default encoding for the form

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we want this to have a false default unlike for Checkin
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we want to allow editing of readonly tables ondemand but it would be confusing to include the Make Editable option when we are already in edit mode so only allow that option when the background model is updateable AND we are not already editing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we want to be able to just use the defaults if JNDI environment properties are not supplied so dont put null in anywhere
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We want to delete rows from the end of the table towards the beginning of the table If we delete from the front to the back that throws off the indexes of the rows after each delete and we would have to compensate for that Example if we want to delete rows 2 and 4 and do it in that order then after deleteing row 2 the row that used to be row 4 is now actually row 3 so we would have to subtract 1 from the index to get the row to delete On the other hand if we delete row 4 first then the indexes of all rows prior to that one have not been affected so we can then delete row 2 without any complications
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We want to detect two empty text values in a row before we decide to restore the original value Since text contains the new value we want to allow the first empty text so that the user can clear the field and on the second one we will set it to the original value
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We want to display the folder the same way you would enter it on the command line so we remove the View name which is also the name of the root folder and therefore shows up at the start of the path
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we want to maintain a minimum size for the partition

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we were woken up without being selectedpoll for thread events and go back to sleep
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We will create an EAttribute EReference or an EOperation 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we will highlight tokens until we reach a good stopping place the first obvious stopping place is the end of the document the lexer will return null at the end of the document and wee need to stop there
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We will iterate over the whole collection removing some as we go 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We will need to check the containment if we have to convert the EAttribute to an EReference later 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we will need to create new entries
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we will need to remove ye olde entries
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We will now create a command with this implied parent
