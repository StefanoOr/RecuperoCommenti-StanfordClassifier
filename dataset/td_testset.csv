WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NB These must agree with the new member names in SampleSaveConfiguration $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NB this class is shared between threads NoThreadClone so all access to variables needs to be protected by a lock either sync or volatile to ensure safe publication 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NB this closes in
DESIGN	TODO Does this method need to be public? It isnt currently called outside of this class
DESIGN	TODO does this really need to be here? does the collection already have its own uptodate snapshot?
DESIGN	TODO dont use deprecated method
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	NB we dont wait for the thread to complete as that would prevent parallel TGs
DESIGN	TODO eliminate?
DESIGN	TODO field always true what for ?
DESIGN	TODO figure out a more reliable way to handle OTHER type which indicates a databasespecific type
DESIGN	TODO Find a way to replace this dependency on Project
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Need this since join condition can appear inside parens!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to account for case where upper==00
DESIGN	TODO fix the space above
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to change selection Set ignore flag
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to check if we are at EOF already
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Need to clamp source buffer size to avoid overrun

DESIGN	TODO Generalize this typechecking code into IRubyObject helper
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to convert entries of props to PropValue instances
DESIGN	TODO get SQL rendering out of this package!
DESIGN	TODO getAllPossibleSubvertices and getAllSubStates are duplicates tfm
DESIGN	TODO Handle multiple top level packages
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Need to initialize
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to let b through so that backspace will work in HistoryTextFields
DESIGN	TODO Having Critics actions here introduces an unnecessary dependency on the Critics subsystem Have it register its desired actions using an extension mechanism tfm
DESIGN	TODO I believe the following code to the end of the method is obsolete since NamePanel no longer seems to be the GUI for any component
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	need to skip IncludedModuleWrappers
DESIGN	TODO ideally we need the construction of PropertyAccessor to take the following 1 EntityMode 2 EntityModespecific data ie the classname for pojo entities 3 Propertyspecific data based on the EntityMode ie propertyname or dom4jnodename The easiest way with the introduction of the new runtimemetamodel classes would be the the following predicates 1 PropertyAccessorFactorygetPropertyAccessor takes references to both a orghibernatemetadataEntityModeMetadata and orghibernatemetadataProperty 2 What is now termed a PropertyAccessor stores any values needed from those two pieces of information 3 Code can then simply call PropertyAccessgetGetter with no parameters likewise with PropertyAccessorgetSetter
DESIGN	TODO Im concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403 So should we consider something to exist even though access if unauthorized or forbidden? 
DESIGN	TODO In UML 2x a TagDefinition has become a Property on a Stereotype Anything that uses this will probably need to be reviewedchanged Just return Property for now
DESIGN	TODO In UML2x Event has no parameters The Event metaclass in UML1x corresponds to the Trigger metaclass in UML2x see UML Superstructure page 456
DESIGN	TODO Is this critics embedded in comments actually used by anyone?
DESIGN	TODO is this ever used?
DESIGN	TODO Is this really needed?
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	negative paint
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	negativeItemLabelFallbackPosition
DESIGN	TODO is this the correct default?
DESIGN	TODO it might be a good idea to keep a reference to the color specified in setPaint or setColor rather than creating a new object every time getPaint is called
DESIGN	TODO It would be really really nice to use this to also model components!
DESIGN	TODO iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions 1 transientCopyCachesize == 0 2 transientCopyCachesize is not decreasing and copyCachesize is not increasing TODO find out if retrying can add entities to copyCache dont think it can For now just retry once throw TransientObjectException if there are still any transient entities
DESIGN	TODO just a guess probably not right tfm return handle instanceof LinkEndData
DESIGN	TODO keep seperate notions of QT here for shallownonshallow queries
DESIGN	TODO make more efficient by not creating IRubyArray
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	never null
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	new behaviour $X maps to $X for all values of X!=$
DESIGN	TODO make this the factory for entity mode related sessions also means making this the target of transactionsynch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions At that point perhaps this thing is a SessionContext and ConnectionManager is a JDBCContext? A SessionContext should live in the impl package
DESIGN	TODO Method with 0 reference really useful ?
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	New env varappend the previous one if we have it

DESIGN	TODO switch statements are always evil! We already had bugs because of forgotten token types Use polymorphism for this!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	No Generalizations on Deployment Diagram
DESIGN	TODO temporary let tree expand implicitly tfm
DESIGN	TODO The above doesnt work reliably in a constructor We need a better way of getting default fig settings for the owning project rather than using the project manager singleton tfm
DESIGN	TODO The above populate works but seems rather heavy here I can see something like this is needed though as events wont manage this quick enough Could we make FigEditableCompartmentcreateModelElement create the new child Fig instance? It may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return Bob
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no luck Ignore this class

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	No need to check it again
DESIGN	TODO this doesnt belong in the implementation specific piece tfm
DESIGN	TODO This first loop just to count the items appears redundant to me tfm 20070630
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	No need to keep track of Bccd addresses
DESIGN	TODO This is a temporary method of making sure the model is updated on loss of focus of a combo box In the long term we should attempt to update the model on each keypress see javaawteventFocusListenerfocusLostjavaawteventFocusEvent 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no need to synchronize as Vector is always synchronized
DESIGN	TODO This is an absurdly long method! Break it up
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no new methods
DESIGN	TODO This is faster than many charAt calls 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no new methods added
DESIGN	TODO This is not according the contract for this function but it is used in several places and I MVW presume that we need this generally This part 1 is about drawing an <<import>> permission between packages The part 2 below is about ModelManagementElementImport 
DESIGN	TODO this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
DESIGN	TODO this is very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since it does not take advantage of twophaseload
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	No point continuing Mainly for bshEvalError
DESIGN	TODO This probably needs more qualification tfm
DESIGN	TODO this should be a configurable property

DESIGN	todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
DESIGN	TODO We currently delete the old values before setting to something new This is a workaround to issue 6056 We should consider giving an API to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values
DESIGN	TODO We definitely dont want to react to addition and removal of transitions Cant we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener
DESIGN	TODO we didnt check the width yet
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no whitespace
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	no wrapround check
DESIGN	TODO We need a specific exception type here
DESIGN	TODO We should really test the model instead for this but we have no API yet Can we just check if the collection to build the JList control implements the List interface?

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This does the assignment!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this doesnt support I18N or multiple states but its just a default
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This doesnt work in UML2 both owner and property needed!
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Ensure that an external entity resolves as expected Using an XMLCatalog Transform an XML file that refers to the entity into a text file entity is listed in the XMLCatalog pointing to a different file Stuff result into property val2 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Ensure that directory URLs end in $NONNLS1$ $NONNLS1$

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	ensure the manager is initialised we dont currently need to do anything further as this sets the default https protocol
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Ensure there are no extraneous style bits 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this has been shown to happen occasionally in rare cases when using a transaction manager + transactiontimeout where the timeout calls back through Hibernates registered transaction synchronization on a separate reaping thread In cases where that reaping thread executes through this block at the same time the main application thread does we can get into situations where these CMEs occur And though it is not allowed perse the end result without handling it specifically is infinite looping So here we simply break the loop

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Entry class
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is a tool window
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Entry class
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Entry constructor
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is almost implausible but required handling
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is CONCAT and new child is CONCAT
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Enumerate the current children of node to find out which now sorts in different order since these must be moved
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is expected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	EOL was rn

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is for brute force detection of columns whose column size is 0
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is for the helper feature

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is for the topDown feature 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is guaranteed by FileUtilscreateTempFile
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Equivalent of DataGetStruct This will first check that the object in question is actually a TDATA equivalent
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is included
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is needed for OnceOnly to work like other Loop Controllers 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	error level logging for compiler errors
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is not a requirement
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	errorDetected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is not one of our included segment skip it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Errors
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is only needed afaict for ResultTransformer processing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is pretty inefficient for building an array so just raise an error if someones using it for a lot of elements
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is required so that see orgapachejmeterguitreeJMeterTreeModelgetNodesOfType can find the Clearable nodes the userObject has to implement the interface
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Escaped dollar commma and backslash with no variable reference
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is somewhat inconsistent with the design of the constructor that receives the root object by argument If this is okay then there may be no need for a constructor with that argument
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Essentially 1 If we have a local Hibernate transaction in progress and it already has the UserTransaction cached use that UserTransaction to determine the status 2 If a transaction manager has been located use that transaction manager to determine the status 3 Finally as the last resort try to lookup the UserTransaction via JNDI and use that to determine the status
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Estimate the square root with the foremost 62 bits of squarD bi and scale are a tandem
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is the column on which the constraint to be dropped is defined
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	ETypeParameterImpl
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is the last period but it is only partially visible so check that the label will fit before displaying it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is the legacy behaviour for HQL queries
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this is the list of lu
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is the method that gets invoked when the operation runs 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Evaluate the condition which can be blank or LAST = was the last sampler OK? otherwise evaluate the condition to see if it is not false If blank only evaluate at the end of the loop Must only be called at start and end of loop param loopEnd are we at loop end? return true means OK to continue 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Evaluate the constructor
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is the proper behavior for all nonexpanded assigners which have a pre > 0 The rest override this 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	even if installDirectory is different 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is the tooltip of a comment link
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This is used as an error indicator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Even though this is not relevant for UML2 we have code calling this that expects it for UML14 and we must handle it gracefully
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	event handlers
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	event handling
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	event handling
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	event processing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this may be a java14 thingy only
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This means the cookie was wrong for the URL
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	every condition is xored against the previous one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method exists for us to break up multiple expression when nodes eg when 123 into individual whenNodes The primary reason for this is to ensure lazy evaluation of the arguments when foobargar to prevent sideeffects In the old code this was done using nested when statements which was awful for interpreter and compilation Notes This has semantic equivalence but will not be lexically equivalent Compiler needs to detect same bodies to simplify bytecode generated 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Everything fine 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this method is invoked from several places so we have to check whether if the project uri is set or not
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method should be implemented assuming its valid to do startstopstart leave state appropriate for another start
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Exact match
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This method takes as input a map of operands to their values and outputs If the value map provides a value for any of the instructions operands this method is expected to replace the original operands with the simplified values It is not required that it do so code correctness is not compromised by failure to simplify 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	example configuration treexml <filter description=gnome enabled=true> <rules condition=matchany> <criteria criteria=contains headerfield=To or Cc pattern=gnome type=To or Cc><criteria> <rules> <actionlist> <action uid=120 type=Move Message><action> <actionlist> <filter> 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This needs to iterate to fill entire output raster if implemented return imagecopyDataoutRaster
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this plugin doesnt define a category to which it belongs
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	execute
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This point is only reached if there was an exception handler installed
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This production is to determine lookahead only
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this profiling point is parent of the next one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this rectangle marks the whole modelelement figure
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	execute filter
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	execute nodes skipping labels until a break or return
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This should always be true but just in case
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	execute resyncing command
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	execute search
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this should never happen
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This should not be needed if the above is correct but lets be sure 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this should not happen except if parent has been deleted by another process
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Execute the sql synchronously
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Execute the sql synchronously
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This should now work
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Execute the sql synchronously
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This should only be possible if the caches are constructor injected 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This should override the default tokenizer
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Execute the sql synchronously
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This solution would allow us to eliminate the owner arg to disassemble but what if the collection was null and then later had elements added? seems unsafe sessiongetPersistenceContextgetCollectionEntry PersistentCollection value getKey
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	executeTargetsetup commented out for performance while target is empty
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this test is a bit stupid but nevertheless
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	exit forloop
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This test tries to emulate a http sample with two subsamples representing images that are downloaded for the page representing the first sample
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This theme was presented to SQuirreL by Karsten Lentzsch of jgoodiescom It is SQuirreLs default theme if the LAF plugin is not used Here we make the AllBluesBoldMetalTheme also available within the LAF plugin Thanks a lot Karsten
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This was originaly done every time and the count of instantiated objects was amazing
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This while loop is for restarting the block call in case a redo fires
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This will actually execute the copy command in order to check if the add can execute 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This will add a new ModelElement event listener after update is complete
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	This will happen when a new file is created
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	this will include the case where the underlying dataset is null

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	Two slashes means we may have authority but definitely means were either matching netpath or abspath These two productions are ambiguous in that every netpath except those containing an IPv6Reference is an abspath RFC 2396 resolves this ambiguity by applying a greedy left most matching rule Try matching netpath first and if that fails we dont have authority so then attempt to match abspath netpath = authority abspath abspath = pathsegments

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need a method operation implementation to store the method body
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we need at least 3 points to spline Draw simple line for two points
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need this method to satisfy one of the Interfaces we implement but since we have moved all operations to the DataType subpanels which initialize their own data during creation there is nothing for us to do here
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	getSimplifiedOperand returns the value of this operand fully simplified getSimplifiedOperand returns the operand in a form that can be materialized into bytecode if it cannot be completely optimized away The value is used during optimizations and propagated through the IR But it is thrown away after that But the operand form is used for constructing the compound objects represented by the operand Example a = 1 b = 34 c = ab d = 2c getValuec = 134 getSimplifiedOperandc = 1 b getValued = 2134 getSimplifiedOperandd = 2 c Note that abcd are all objects and c has a reference to objects a and b and d has a reference to c So if contents of a or b is modified the simplified values of c and d also change! This difference is captured by these two methods
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be careful that the proxy may be resolved while we are attaching this adapter We need to avoid attaching the adapter during the resolve and also attaching it again as we walk the eContents later Checking here avoids having to check during addAdapter 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is builtin and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we normally compare destination with source
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We not sure the encoding supports this code point so we write it as a character entity reference
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We now have the value of the propertyref we reference However we need to dig a little deeper as that property might also be an entity type in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	we only collect methods and interfaces for userdefined proxy classes
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	getting current uid

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	We only need to pass in current scope if we are evaluating as a block which is only done for evals We need to pass this in so that we can appropriately scope down to captured scopes when we are parsing

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if doc is null then for whatever reason the cached file cannot be used
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If eCore return the ENamedElement name 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If equals is not explicitly defined we must override the default implemented by the This object protocol for scripted object To support XThis equals must test for equality with the generated proxy object not the scripted bsh This object otherwise callers from outside in Java will not see a the proxy object as equal to itself

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If method not supported ignore failure
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if multiple axes are mapped the first in the list should be returned
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If neither approach finds a contradiction we must assume they are okay and then check all the arguments 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If no ContentType header was found it is necessary to construct a new one for outgoing msg Eudora never includes a ContentType => html msg is not shown correctly 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if no folder was passed as argument use global options
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If no functionname was given then retain the one in the model 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if no more data could be found set flag stating that the end of the data was found
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if no nested natural order

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If only default is specified and the property previously existed in the property file it is unchanged
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If only Figs without owner are selected then you can remove them! 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If our map has any entries for this type its a connection type
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if package 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if parent is null then we are at the root of the fs complain that we cant find the build file
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if previous node is not commented out but all following are
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if result is already in hashtable remove from result set
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If rn then just pass along n windows If r^n then pass along n MAC

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the buildfile specifies sourcepath= then dont output any sourcepath
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the cause is a IMAPExcpetion then only password wrong else bogus authentication mechanism

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the given class is subclass of enum and node is of subclass of type
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the given name is unqualified we may neen to qualify it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the hour is 0 23 then create an hour
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the layer is null then most likely we are being deleted
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the list does not exist add the code generation and good practices profiles as default
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the notification is an IViewerNotification it specifies how ViewerRefresh should behave Otherwise fall back to NotifyChangedToViewerRefresh which determines how to refresh the viewer directly from the model notification 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the object does not have a name than no problem
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the other end is a many then we should remove the owner from the old values opposite feature so that undo will put it back 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the path is nonempty and originally ended in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the proxy holder can hold many values it may contain a duplicate that resulted when the other end was processed as an IDREF and hence did both sides of the bidirectional relation 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the request entity is repeatable we can send it first to our own stream so we can return it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the row is past the end of our current collection return an empty string so they can add a new value
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the scheme specific part is opaque it can contain and uricnoslash wasnt modified by RFC 2732 which Ive interpreted as an error in the spec since the production should be equivalent to uric and uric contains and mrglavas
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if the source file isnt there throw an exception
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If the source of the event is an UML object eg the owner of this Fig but not always only the owner is shown eg for a class also its attributes are shown then the UML model has been changed

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there are no stereotypes we return 00 preventing double lines in the class see issue 4939
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is a FROM fragment and the FROM element is an explicit then add the from part
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there is an existing dataset remove the plot from the list of change listeners
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is no difference we mark it as not needing encoding
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is no dot then this must be a top level Fig and can be assumed to be a FigNode
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is no field then we cant do this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there is no search engine try the default one
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there is no string given return a number
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there is nothing selected return
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is one file with no parameter name the file will be sent as post body
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there is still a parent > remove it
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If there isnt an executable command we should maybe try a copy operation but only if were allowed and not doing a link 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there was a problem with converting then just fall through and continue as if there was no default given in the DB Otherwise use the converted object
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there was a problem with converting then just fall through and continue as if there was no default given in the DB Otherwise use the converted object

WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if there was a problem with converting then just fall through and continue as if there was no default given in the DB Otherwise use the converted object
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If theres no position the list is being cleared 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If theres only a single child and were its only parent set a hint for where to place it when we get to its row
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If they dont have the same size the feature maps arent equal 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If this file is a directory
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if this is a messageviewer frame viewing a message only the window should be closed too
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If this is an implied join in a FROM clause then use ANSIstyle joining and set the flag on the FromElement that indicates that it was implied in the FROM clause itself
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If this is an implied join in a from element then use the impled join type which is part of the tree parsers state set by the gramamar actions
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If this is elements then create a new FROM element
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If this is just a proxy being resolved 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if this is left out bad things happen like all build files break on the first element encountered
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if this is the last item draw the path 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if this successor has not already been pushed onto the stack
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If type already assignable no cast necessary We do this last to allow various errors above to be caught eg cast PrimitiveVoid to Object would pass this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if use proxy is set we try to pick up the proxy host and port from either the text fields or from JMeterUtil if they were passed from command line
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we are already in the AWT thread take a shortcut
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we are disabling the Edit>Remove menu item and the Edit>Add menu item is disabled then we also need to disable the Edit menu The Java Look and Feel Guidelines say to disable a menu if all menu items are disabled
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we are not limiting anything return false
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we are on the special resource set iterator and there isnt really a next object at this point 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we are storing a name as well index is one too high for values
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we can do a drop on operation 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we cant create one too bad
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we dont have a body check for required or opt args if opt args they could have side effects if required args need to raise errors if too few args passed otherwise method does nothing make it a nop
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we dont have at least 2 x y coordinates just return
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we drop out we didnt meet both criteria and all is well
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we failed to bind the blob in a file try memory
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we find a file attribute then act on a file otherwise act on a project
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we get here no optz cases work fall back on unoptz
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we get here the class and field exist construct our Unsafe impl that calls it directly
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we have a specificarity helper to construct an array for us use that
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we have seen a property for this DataType before then the hashmap already exists Otherwise we need to create it now
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we havent already named an XML file it gets antlibxml
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we hold a Java object we need a javaclass accessor
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we just finish we cant go to sleep until we ensure there is nothing else for us to do use try again to keep track of this
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we modify the original list its best if the URL generator is not affected
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we save a file with the same name as one thats already open we presume that we can close the existing file since the user would have confirmed the overwrite in the save as dialog box anyway 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if we search in The MessageConroller
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If we were handed a Classifier to start this must be a Classifier
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If were not setting a new resource attach it to the old containers resource
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if were not the argument scope for zsuper try our parent
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if were not the argument scope for zsuper try our parent
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If were running in 19 compat mode add Ruby 19 libs to path before 18 libs
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If weve been successful on an update delete the temporary file
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	if window is maximized > ignore the window size properties otherwise use window size property but ensure that the window is completly visible on the desktop
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If you add this method to one of the standard DataTypes in the fwdatasetviewercellcomponent directory you must also add the name of that DataType class to the list in CellComponentFactory method getControlPanels variable named initialClassNameList If the class is being registered with the factory using registerDataType then you should not include the class name in the list it will be found automatically but if the DataType is part of the case statement in the factory method getDataTypeObject then it does need to be explicitly listed in the getControlPanels method also 
WITHOUTCLASSIFICATION	If you dont do this you get all sorts of annoying warnings about a missing properties file However it seems to work just fine with default values Ultimately we should probably include a CatalogManagerproperties file in the ant jarfile with some default property settings See CatalogManagerjava for more details
